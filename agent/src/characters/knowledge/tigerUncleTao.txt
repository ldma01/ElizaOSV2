    "_ ## Introduction The _Tao Te Ching_ was probably written about twenty-five hundred years ago, perhaps by a man called Lao Tzu, who may have lived at about the same time as Confucius.",
    "Nothing about it is certain except that it’s Chinese, and very old, and speaks to people everywhere as if it had been written yesterday.",
    "The first _Tao Te Ching_ I ever saw was the Paul Carus edition of 1898, bound in yellow cloth stamped with blue and red Chinese designs and characters.",
    "It was a venerable object of mystery, which I soon investigated, and found more fascinating inside than out.",
    "The book was my father’s; he read in it often.",
    "Once I saw him making notes from it and asked what he was doing.",
    "He said he was marking which chapters he’d like to have read at his funeral.",
    "We did read those chapters at his memorial service.",
    "I have the book, now ninety-eight years old and further ornamented with red binding-tape to hold the back on, and have marked which chapters I’d like to have read at my funeral.",
    "In the Notes, I explain why I was so lucky to discover Lao Tzu in that particular edition.",
    "Here I will only say that I was lucky to discover him so young, so that I could live with his book my whole life long.",
    "I also discuss other aspects of my version in the Notes—the how of it.",
    "Here I want to state very briefly the why of it.",
    "The _Tao Te Ching_ is partly in prose, partly in verse; but as we define poetry now, not by rhyme and meter but as a patterned intensity of language, the whole thing is poetry.",
    "I wanted to catch that poetry, its terse, strange beauty.",
    "Most translations have caught meanings in their net, but prosily, letting the beauty slip through.",
    "And in poetry, beauty is no ornament; it is the meaning.",
    "It is the truth.",
    "We have that on good authority.",
    "Scholarly translations of the _Tao Te Ching_ as a manual for rulers use a vocabulary that emphasizes the uniqueness of the Taoist “sage,” his masculinity, his authority.",
    "This language is perpetuated, and degraded, in most popular versions.",
    "I wanted a Book of the Way accessible to a present-day, unwise, unpowerful, and perhaps unmale reader, not seeking esoteric secrets, but listening for a voice that speaks to the soul.",
    "I would like that reader to see why people have loved the book for twenty-five hundred years.",
    "It is the most lovable of all the great religious texts, funny, keen, kind, modest, indestructibly outrageous, and inexhaustibly refreshing.",
    "Of all the deep springs, this is the purest water.",
    "To me, it is also the deepest spring.",
    "—Ursula K.",
    "Le Guin Commentaries at the foot of some of the chapters are my own responses to the text.",
    "They are idiosyncratic and unscholarly, and are to be ignored if not found helpful.",
    "In the Notes at the end of the book are more detailed considerations of some of the chapters, thanks to my sources and guides, and remarks on how I arrived at my version.",
    "# BOOK ONE #### 1 ### Taoing  The way you can go isn’t the real way.",
    "The name you can say isn’t the real name.",
    "Heaven and earth begin in the unnamed: name’s the mother of the ten thousand things.",
    "So the unwanting soul sees what’s hidden, and the ever-wanting soul sees only what it wants.",
    "Two things, one origin, but different in name, whose identity is mystery.",
    "Mystery of all mysteries.",
    "The door to the hidden.",
    "A satisfactory translation of this chapter is, I believe, perfectly impossible.",
    "It contains the book.",
    "I think of it as the Aleph, in Borges’s story: if you see it rightly, it contains everything.",
    "#### 2 ### Soul food  Everybody on earth knowing that beauty is beautiful makes ugliness.",
    "Everybody knowing that goodness is good makes wickedness.",
    "For being and nonbeing arise together; hard and easy complete each other; long and short shape each other; high and low depend on each other; note and voice make the music together; before and after follow each other.",
    "That’s why the wise soul does without doing, teaches without talking.",
    "The things of this world exist, they are; you can’t refuse them.",
    "To bear and not to own;  to act and not lay claim; to do the work and let it go: for just letting it go is what makes it stay.",
    "One of the things I read in this chapter is that values and beliefs are not only culturally constructed but also part of the interplay of yin and yang, the great reversals that maintain the living balance of the world.",
    "To believe that our beliefs are permanent truths which encompass reality is a sad arrogance.",
    "To let go of that belief is to find safety.",
    "#### 3 ### Hushing  Not praising the praiseworthy keeps people uncompetitive.",
    "Not prizing rare treasures keeps people from stealing.",
    "Not looking at the desirable keeps the mind quiet.",
    "So the wise soul governing people would empty their minds, fill their bellies, weaken their wishes, strengthen their bones,  keep people unknowing, unwanting, keep the ones who do know from doing anything.",
    "When you do not-doing, nothing’s out of order.",
    "Over and over Lao Tzu says _wei wu wei_ : Do not do.",
    "Doing not-doing.",
    "To act without acting.",
    "Action by inaction.",
    "You do nothing yet it gets done.",
    "It’s not a statement susceptible to logical interpretation, or even to a syntactical translation into English; but it’s a concept that transforms thought radically, that changes minds.",
    "The whole book is both an explanation and a demonstration of it.",
    "#### 4 ### Sourceless  The way is empty, used, but not used up.",
    "Deep, yes.",
    "ancestral to the ten thousand things.",
    "Blunting edge, loosing bond, dimming light, the way is the dust of the way.",
    "Quiet, yes, and likely to endure.",
    "Whose child.",
    "born before the gods.",
    "Everything Lao Tzu says is elusive.",
    "The temptation is to grasp at something tangible in the endlessly deceptive simplicity of the words.",
    "Even some of his finest scholarly translators focus on positive ethical or political values in the text, as if those were what’s important in it.",
    "And of course the religion called Taoism is full of gods, saints, miracles, prayers, rules, methods for securing riches, power, longevity, and so forth—all the stuff that Lao Tzu says leads us away from the Way.",
    "In passages such as this one, I think it is the profound modesty of the language that offers what so many people for so many centuries have found in this book: a pure apprehension of the mystery of which we are part.",
    "#### 5 ### Useful emptiness  Heaven and earth aren’t humane.",
    "To them the ten thousand things are straw dogs.",
    "Wise souls aren’t humane.",
    "To them the hundred families are straw dogs.",
    "Heaven and earth act as a bellows:  Empty yet structured, it moves, inexhaustibly giving.",
    "The “inhumanity” of the wise soul doesn’t mean cruelty.",
    "Cruelty is a human characteristic.",
    "Heaven and earth—that is, “Nature” and its Way—are not humane, because they are not human.",
    "They are not kind; they are not cruel: those are human attributes.",
    "You can only be kind or cruel if you have, and cherish, a self.",
    "You can’t even be indifferent if you aren’t different.",
    "Altruism is the other side of egoism.",
    "Followers of the Way, like the forces of nature, act selflessly.",
    "#### 6 ### What is complete  The valley spirit never dies.",
    "Call it the mystery, the woman.",
    "The mystery, the Door of the Woman, is the root of earth and heaven.",
    "Forever this endures, forever.",
    "And all its uses are easy.",
    "#### 7 ### Dim brightness  Heaven will last, earth will endure.",
    "How can they last so long.",
    "They don’t exist for themselves and so can go on and on.",
    "So wise souls leaving self behind move forward, and setting self aside stay centered.",
    "Why let the self go.",
    "To keep what the soul needs.",
    "#### 8 ### Easy by nature  True goodness is like water.",
    "Water’s good for everything.",
    "It doesn’t compete.",
    "It goes right to the low loathsome places, and so finds the way.",
    "For a house, the good thing is level ground.",
    "In thinking, depth is good.",
    "The good of giving is magnanimity; of speaking, honesty; of government, order.",
    "The good of work is skill, and of action, timing.",
    "No competition, so no blame.",
    "A clear stream of water runs through this book, from poem to poem, wearing down the indestructible, finding the way around everything that obstructs the way.",
    "Good drinking water.",
    "#### 9 ### Being quiet  Brim-fill the bowl, it’ll spill over.",
    "Keep sharpening the blade, you’ll soon blunt it.",
    "Nobody can protect a house full of gold and jade.",
    "Wealth, status, pride, are their own ruin.",
    "To do good, work well, and lie low is the way of the blessing.",
    "#### 10 ### Techniques  Can you keep your soul in its body, hold fast to the one, and so learn to be whole.",
    "Can you center your energy, be soft, tender, and so learn to be a baby.",
    "Can you keep the deep water still and clear, so it reflects without blurring.",
    "Can you love people and run things, and do so by not doing.",
    "Opening, closing the Gate of Heaven, can you be like a bird with her nestlings.",
    "Piercing bright through the cosmos, can you know by not knowing.",
    "To give birth, to nourish, to bear and not to own, to act and not lay claim, to lead and not to rule: this is mysterious power.",
    "Most of the scholars think this chapter is about meditation, its techniques and fulfillments.",
    "The language is profoundly mystical, the images are charged, rich in implications.",
    "The last verse turns up in nearly the same words in other chapters; there are several such “refrains” throughout the book, identical or similar lines repeated once or twice or three times.",
    "#### 11 ### The uses of not  Thirty spokes meet in the hub.",
    "Where the wheel isn’t is where it’s useful.",
    "Hollowed out, clay makes a pot.",
    "Where the pot’s not is where it’s useful.",
    "Cut doors and windows to make a room.",
    "Where the room isn’t, there’s room for you.",
    "So the profit in what is is in the use of what isn’t.",
    "One of the things I love about Lao Tzu is he is so funny.",
    "He’s explaining a profound and difficult truth here, one of those counterintuitive truths that, when the mind can accept them, suddenly double the size of the universe.",
    "He goes about it with this deadpan simplicity, talking about pots.",
    "#### 12 ### Not wanting  The five colors blind our eyes.",
    "The five notes deafen our ears.",
    "The five flavors dull our taste.",
    "Racing, chasing, hunting, drives people crazy.",
    "Trying to get rich ties people in knots.",
    "So the wise soul watches with the inner not the outward eye, letting that go, keeping this.",
    "#### 13 ### Shameless  To be in favor or disgrace is to live in fear.",
    "To take the body seriously is to admit one can suffer.",
    "What does that mean, to be in favor or disgrace is to live in fear.",
    "Favor debases: we fear to lose it, fear to win it.",
    "So to be in favor or disgrace is to live in fear.",
    "What does that mean, to take the body seriously is to admit one can suffer.",
    "I suffer because I’m a body; if I weren’t a body, how could I suffer.",
    "So people who set their bodily good before the public good could be entrusted with the commonwealth, and people who treated the body politic as gently as their own body would be worthy to govern the commonwealth.",
    "Lao Tzu, a mystic, demystifies political power.",
    "Autocracy and oligarchy foster the beliefs that power is gained magically and retained by sacrifice, and that powerful people are genuinely superior to the powerless.",
    "Lao Tzu does not see political power as magic.",
    "He sees rightful power as earned and wrongful power as usurped.",
    "He does not see power as virtue, but as the result of virtue.",
    "The democracies are founded on that view.",
    "He sees sacrifice of self or others as a corruption of power, and power as available to anybody who follows the Way.",
    "This is a radically subversive attitude.",
    "No wonder anarchists and Taoists make good friends.",
    "#### 14 ### Celebrating mystery  Look at it: nothing to see.",
    "Call it colorless.",
    "Listen to it: nothing to hear.",
    "Call it soundless.",
    "Reach for it: nothing to hold.",
    "Call it intangible.",
    "Triply undifferentiated, it merges into oneness, not bright above, not dark below.",
    "Never, oh.",
    "never can it be named.",
    "It reverts, it returns to unbeing.",
    "Call it the form of the unformed, the image of no image.",
    "Call it unthinkable thought.",
    "Face it: no face.",
    "Follow it: no end.",
    "Holding fast to the old Way, we can live in the present.",
    "Mindful of the ancient beginnings, we hold the thread of the Tao.",
    "#### 15 ### People of power  Once upon a time people who knew the Way were subtle, spiritual, mysterious, penetrating, unfathomable.",
    "Since they’re inexplicable I can only say what they seemed like: Cautious, oh yes, as if wading through a winter river.",
    "Alert, as if afraid of the neighbors.",
    "Polite and quiet, like houseguests.",
    "Elusive, like melting ice.",
    "Blank, like uncut wood.",
    "Empty, like valleys.",
    "Mysterious, oh yes, they were like troubled water.",
    "Who can by stillness, little by little make what is troubled grow clear.",
    "Who can by movement, little by little make what is still grow quick.",
    "To follow the Way is not to need fulfillment.",
    "Unfulfilled, one may live on needing no renewal.",
    "In the first stanza we see the followers of the Way in ancient times or _illo tempore_ , remote and inaccessible; but the second stanza brings them close and alive in a series of marvelous similes.",
    "(I am particularly fond of the polite and quiet houseguests.",
    ") The images of the valley and of uncut or uncarved wood will recur again and again.",
    "#### 16 ### Returning to the root  Be completely empty.",
    "Be perfectly serene.",
    "The ten thousand things arise together; in their arising is their return.",
    "Now they flower, and flowering sink homeward, returning to the root.",
    "The return to the root is peace.",
    "Peace: to accept what must be, to know what endures.",
    "In that knowledge is wisdom.",
    "Without it, ruin, disorder.",
    "To know what endures is to be openhearted, magnanimous, regal, blessed, following the Tao, the way that endures forever.",
    "The body comes to its ending, but there is nothing to fear.",
    "To those who will not admit morality without a deity to validate it, or spirituality of which man is not the measure, the firmness of Lao Tzu’s morality and the sweetness of his spiritual counsel must seem incomprehensible, or illegitimate, or very troubling indeed.",
    "#### 17 ### Acting simply  True leaders are hardly known to their followers.",
    "Next after them are the leaders the people know and admire; after them, those they fear; after them, those they despise.",
    "To give no trust is to get no trust.",
    "When the work’s done right, with no fuss or boasting, ordinary people say, Oh, we did it.",
    "This invisible leader, who gets things done in such a way that people think they did it all themselves, isn’t one who manipulates others from behind the scenes; just the opposite.",
    "Again, it’s a matter of “doing without doing”: uncompetitive, unworried, trustful accomplishment, power that is not force.",
    "An example or analogy might be a very good teacher, or the truest voice in a group of singers.",
    "#### 18 ### Second bests  In the degradation of the great way come benevolence and righteousness.",
    "With the exaltation of learning and prudence comes immense hypocrisy.",
    "The disordered family is full of dutiful children and parents.",
    "The disordered society is full of loyal patriots.",
    "#### 19 ### Raw silk and uncut wood  Stop being holy, forget being prudent, it’ll be a hundred times better for everyone.",
    "Stop being altruistic, forget being righteous, people will remember what family feeling is.",
    "Stop planning, forget making a profit, there won’t be any thieves and robbers.",
    "But even these three rules needn’t be followed; what works reliably is to know the raw silk, hold the uncut wood.",
    "Need little, want less.",
    "Forget the rules.",
    "Be untroubled.",
    "This chapter and the two before it may be read as a single movement of thought.",
    "“Raw silk” and “uncut wood” are images traditionally associated with the characters _su_ (simple, plain) and _p_ ’ _u_ (natural, honest).",
    "#### 20 ### Being different  How much difference between yes and no.",
    "What difference between good and bad.",
    "What the people fear must be feared.",
    "O desolation.",
    "Not yet, not yet has it reached its limit.",
    "Everybody’s cheerful, cheerful as if at a party, or climbing a tower in springtime.",
    "And here I sit unmoved, clueless, like a child, a baby too young to smile.",
    "Forlorn, forlorn.",
    "Like a homeless person.",
    "Most people have plenty.",
    "I’m the one that’s poor, a fool right through.",
    "Ignorant, ignorant.",
    "Most people are so bright.",
    "I’m the one that’s dull.",
    "Most people are so keen.",
    "I don’t have the answers.",
    "Oh, I’m desolate, at sea, adrift, without harbor.",
    "Everybody has something to do.",
    "I’m the clumsy one, out of place.",
    "I’m the different one, for my food is the milk of the mother.",
    "The difference between yes and no, good and bad, is something only the “bright” people, the people with the answers, can understand.",
    "A poor stupid Taoist can’t make it out.",
    "This chapter is full of words like _huang_ (wild, barren; famine), _tun_ (ignorant; chaotic), _hun_ (dull, turbid), _men_ (sad, puzzled, mute), and _hu_ (confused, obscured, vague).",
    "They configure chaos, confusion, a “bewilderness” in which the mind wanders without certainties, desolate, silent, awkward.",
    "But in that milky, dim strangeness lies the way.",
    "It can’t be found in the superficial order imposed by positive and negative opinions, the good/bad, yes/no moralizing that denies fear and ignores mystery.",
    "#### 21 ### The empty heart  The greatest power is the gift of following the Way alone.",
    "How the Way does things is hard to grasp, elusive.",
    "Elusive, yes, hard to grasp, yet there are thoughts in it.",
    "Hard to grasp, yes, elusive, yet there are things in it.",
    "Hard to make out, yes, and obscure, yet there is spirit in it, veritable spirit.",
    "There is certainty in it.",
    "From long, long ago till now it has kept its name.",
    "So it saw the beginning of everything.",
    "How do I know anything about the beginning.",
    "By this.",
    "Mysticism rises from and returns to the irreducible, unsayable reality of “this.",
    "” “This” is the Way.",
    "This is the way.",
    "#### 22 ### Growing downward  Be broken to be whole.",
    "Twist to be straight.",
    "Be empty to be full.",
    "Wear out to be renewed.",
    "Have little and gain much.",
    "Have much and get confused.",
    "So wise souls hold to the one, and test all things against it.",
    "Not showing themselves, they shine forth.",
    "Not justifying themselves, they’re self-evident.",
    "Not praising themselves, they’re accomplished.",
    "Not competing, they have in all the world no competitor.",
    "What they used to say in the old days, “Be broken to be whole,” was that mistaken.",
    "Truly, to be whole is to return.",
    "#### 23 ### Nothing and not  Nature doesn’t make long speeches.",
    "A whirlwind doesn’t last all morning.",
    "A cloudburst doesn’t last all day.",
    "Who makes the wind and rain.",
    "Heaven and earth do.",
    "If heaven and earth don’t go on and on, certainly people don’t need to.",
    "The people who work with Tao are Tao people, they belong to the Way.",
    "People who work with power belong to power.",
    "People who work with loss belong to what’s lost.",
    "Give yourself to the Way and you’ll be at home on the Way.",
    "Give yourself to power and you’ll be at home in power.",
    "Give yourself to loss and when you’re lost you’ll be at home.",
    "To give no trust is to get no trust.",
    "#### 24 ### Proportion  You can’t keep standing on tiptoe or walk in leaps and bounds.",
    "You can’t shine by showing off or get ahead by pushing.",
    "Self-satisfied people do no good, self-promoters never grow up.",
    "Such stuff is to the Tao as garbage is to food or a tumor to the body, hateful.",
    "The follower of the Way avoids it.",
    "#### 25 ### Imagining mystery  There is something that contains everything.",
    "Before heaven and earth it is.",
    "Oh, it is still, unbodied, all on its own, unchanging,  all-pervading, ever-moving.",
    "So it can act as the mother of all things.",
    "Not knowing its real name, we only call it the Way.",
    "If it must be named, let its name be Great.",
    "Greatness means going on, going on means going far, and going far means turning back.",
    "So they say: “The Way is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and humankind is great; four greatnesses in the world, and humanity is one of them.",
    "”  People follow earth, earth follows heaven,  heaven follows the Way, the Way follows what is.",
    "I’d like to call the “something” of the first line a lump—an unshaped, undifferentiated lump, chaos, before the Word, before Form, before Change.",
    "Inside it is time, space, everything; in the womb of the Way.",
    "The last words of the chapter, _tzu jan_ , I render as “what is.",
    "” I was tempted to say, “The Way follows itself,” because the Way is the way things are; but that would reduce the significance of the words.",
    "They remind us not to see the Way as a sovereignty or a domination, all creative, all yang.",
    "The Way itself is a follower.",
    "Though it is before everything, it follows what is.",
    "#### 26 ### Power of the heavy  Heavy is the root of light.",
    "Still is the master of moving.",
    "So wise souls make their daily march with the heavy baggage wagon.",
    "Only when safe in a solid, quiet house do they lay care aside.",
    "How can a lord of ten thousand chariots let his own person weigh less in the balance than his land.",
    "Lightness will lose him his foundation, movement will lose him his mastery.",
    "I take heaviness to be the root matters of daily life, the baggage we bodily beings have to carry, such as food, drink, shelter, safety.",
    "If you go charging too far ahead of the baggage wagon you may be cut off from it; if you treat your body as unimportant you risk insanity or inanity.",
    "The first two lines would make a nice motto for the practice of T’ai Chi.",
    "#### 27 ### Skill  Good walkers leave no track.",
    "Good talkers don’t stammer.",
    "Good counters don’t use their fingers.",
    "The best door’s unlocked and unopened.",
    "The best knot’s not in a rope and can’t be untied.",
    "So wise souls are good at caring for people, never turning their back on anyone.",
    "They’re good at looking after things, never turning their back on anything.",
    "There’s a light hidden here.",
    "Good people teach people who aren’t good yet; the less good are the makings of the good.",
    "Anyone who doesn’t respect a teacher or cherish a student may be clever, but has gone astray.",
    "There’s a deep mystery here.",
    "The hidden light and the deep mystery seem to be signals, saying “think about this”—about care for what seems unimportant.",
    "In a teacher’s parental care for the insignificant student, and in a society’s respect for mothers, teachers, and other obscure people who educate, there is indeed illumination and a profoundly human mystery.",
    "Having replaced instinct with language, society, and culture, we are the only species that depends on teaching and learning.",
    "We aren’t human without them.",
    "In them is true power.",
    "But are they the occupations of the rich and mighty.",
    "#### 28 ### Turning back  Knowing man and staying woman, be the riverbed of the world.",
    "Being the world’s riverbed of eternal unfailing power is to go back again to be newborn.",
    "Knowing light and staying dark, be a pattern to the world.",
    "Being the world’s pattern of eternal unerring power is to go back again to boundlessness.",
    "Knowing glory and staying modest, be the valley of the world.",
    "Being the world’s valley of eternal inexhaustible power is to go back again to the natural.",
    "Natural wood is cut up and made into useful things.",
    "Wise souls are used to make into leaders.",
    "Just so, a great carving is done without cutting.",
    "The simplicity of Lao Tzu’s language can present an almost impenetrable density of meaning.",
    "The reversals and paradoxes in this great poem are the oppositions of the yin and yang—male/female, light/dark, glory/modesty—but the “knowing and being” of them, the balancing act, results in neither stasis nor synthesis.",
    "The riverbed in which power runs leads back, the patterns of power lead back, the valley where power is contained leads back—to the forever new, endless, straightforward way.",
    "Reversal, recurrence, are the movement, and yet the movement is onward.",
    "#### 29 ### Not doing  Those who think to win the world by doing something to it, I see them come to grief.",
    "For the world is a sacred object.",
    "Nothing is to be done to it.",
    "To do anything to it is to damage it.",
    "To seize it is to lose it.",
    "Under heaven some things lead, some follow, some blow hot, some cold, some are strong, some weak, some are fulfilled, some fail.",
    "So the wise soul keeps away from the extremes, excess, extravagance.",
    "For Lao Tzu, “moderation in all things” isn’t just a bit of safe, practical advice.",
    "To lose the sense of the sacredness of the world is a mortal loss.",
    "To injure our world by excesses of greed and ingenuity is to endanger our own sacredness.",
    "#### 30 ### Not making war  A Taoist wouldn’t advise a ruler to use force of arms for conquest; that tactic backfires.",
    "Where the army marched grow thorns and thistles.",
    "After the war come the bad harvests.",
    "Good leaders prosper, that’s all, not presuming on victory.",
    "They prosper without boasting, or domineering, or arrogance, prosper because they can’t help it, prosper without violence.",
    "Things flourish then perish.",
    "Not the Way.",
    "What’s not the Way soon ends.",
    "This first direct statement of Lao Tzu’s pacifism is connected in thought to the previous poem and leads directly to the next.",
    "The last verse is enigmatic: “Things flourish then perish”—How can this supremely natural sequence not be the Way.",
    "I offer my understanding of it in the note on the page with chapter 55, where nearly the same phrase occurs.",
    "#### 31 ### Against war  Even the best weapon is an unhappy tool, hateful to living things.",
    "So the follower of the Way stays away from it.",
    "Weapons are unhappy tools, not chosen by thoughtful people, to be used only when there is no choice, and with a calm, still mind, without enjoyment.",
    "To enjoy using weapons is to enjoy killing people, and to enjoy killing people is to lose your share in the common good.",
    "It is right that the murder of many people be mourned and lamented.",
    "It is right that a victor in war be received with funeral ceremonies.",
    "#### 32 ### Sacred power  The way goes on forever nameless.",
    "Uncut wood, nothing important, yet nobody under heaven dare try to carve it.",
    "If rulers and leaders could use it, the ten thousand things would gather in homage, heaven and earth would drop sweet dew, and people, without being ordered, would be fair to one another.",
    "To order, to govern, is to begin naming; when names proliferate it’s time to stop.",
    "If you know when to stop you’re in no danger.",
    "The Way in the world is as a stream to a valley, a river to the sea.",
    "The second verse connects the uncut, the uncarved, the unusable, to the idea of the unnamed presented in the first chapter: “name’s the mother of the ten thousand things.",
    "” You have to make order, you have to make distinctions, but you also have to know when to stop before you’ve lost the whole in the multiplicity of parts.",
    "The simplicity or singleness of the Way is that of water, which always rejoins itself.",
    "#### 33 ### Kinds of power  Knowing other people is intelligence, knowing yourself is wisdom.",
    "Overcoming others takes strength, overcoming yourself takes greatness.",
    "Contentment is wealth.",
    "Boldly pushing forward takes resolution.",
    "Staying put keeps you in position.",
    "To live till you die is to live long enough.",
    "#### 34 ### Perfect trust  The Great Way runs to left, to right, the ten thousand things depending on it, living on it, accepted by it.",
    "Doing its work, it goes unnamed.",
    "Clothing and feeding the ten thousand things, it lays no claim on them and asks nothing of them.",
    "Call it a small matter.",
    "The ten thousand things return to it, though it lays no claim on them.",
    "Call it great.",
    "So the wise soul without great doings achieves greatness.",
    "#### 35 ### Humane power  Hold fast to the great thought and all the world will come to you, harmless, peaceable, serene.",
    "Walking around, we stop for music, for food.",
    "But if you taste the Way it’s flat, insipid.",
    "It looks like nothing much, it sounds like nothing much.",
    "And yet you can’t get enough of it.",
    "#### 36 ### The small dark light  What seeks to shrink must first have grown; what seeks weakness surely was strong.",
    "What seeks its ruin must first have risen; what seeks to take has surely given.",
    "This is called the small dark light: the soft, the weak prevail over the hard, the strong.",
    "There is a third stanza in all the texts:  Fish should stay underwater: the real means of rule should be kept dark.",
    "Or, more literally, “the State’s sharp weapons ought not to be shown to the people.",
    "” This Machiavellian truism seems such an anticlimax to the great theme stated in the first verses that I treat it as an intrusion, perhaps a commentator’s practical example of “the small dark light.",
    "” #### 37 ### Over all  The Way never does anything, and everything gets done.",
    "If those in power could hold to the Way, the ten thousand things would look after themselves.",
    "If even so they tried to act, I’d quiet them with the nameless, the natural.",
    "In the unnamed, in the unshapen, is not wanting.",
    "In not wanting is stillness.",
    "In stillness all under heaven rests.",
    "Here the themes of not doing and not wanting, the unnamed and the unshapen, recur together in one pure legato.",
    "It is wonderful how by negatives and privatives Lao Tzu gives a sense of serene, inexhaustible fullness of being.",
    "# BOOK Two #### 38 ### Talking about power  Great power, not clinging to power, has true power.",
    "Lesser power, clinging to power, lacks true power.",
    "Great power, doing nothing, has nothing to do.",
    "Lesser power, doing nothing, has an end in view.",
    "The good the truly good do has no end in view.",
    "The right the very righteous do has an end in view.",
    "And those who act in true obedience to law roll up their sleeves and make the disobedient obey.",
    "So: when we lose the Way we find power; losing power we find goodness; losing goodness we find righteousness; losing righteousness we’re left with obedience.",
    "Obedience to law is the dry husk of loyalty and good faith.",
    "Opinion is the barren flower of the Way, the beginning of ignorance.",
    "So great-minded people abide in the kernel not the husk,  in the fruit not the flower, letting the one go, keeping the other.",
    "A vast, dense argument in a minumum of words, this poem lays out the Taoist values in steeply descending order: the Way and its power; goodness (humane feeling); righteousness (morality); and—a very distant last—obedience (law and order).",
    "The word I render as “opinion” can be read as “knowing too soon”: the mind obeying orders, judging before the evidence is in, closed to fruitful perception and learning.",
    "#### 39 ### Integrity  Those who of old got to be whole:  Heaven through its wholeness is pure; earth through its wholeness is steady; spirit through its wholeness is potent; the valley through its wholeness flows with rivers; the ten thousand things through their wholeness live; rulers through their wholeness have authority.",
    "Their wholeness makes them what they are.",
    "Without what makes it pure, heaven would disintegrate; without what steadies it, earth would crack apart; without what makes it potent, spirit would fail; without what fills it, the valley would run dry; without what quickens them, the ten thousand things would die; without what authorizes them, rulers would fall.",
    "The root of the noble is in the common, the high stands on what’s below.",
    "Princes and kings call themselves “orphans, widowers, beggars,” to get themselves rooted in the dirt.",
    "A multiplicity of riches is poverty.",
    "Jade is praised as precious, but its strength is being stone.",
    "#### 40 ### By no means  Return is how the Way moves.",
    "Weakness is how the Way works.",
    "Heaven and earth and the ten thousand things are born of being.",
    "Being is born of nothing.",
    "#### 41 ### On and off  Thoughtful people hear about the Way and try hard to follow it.",
    "Ordinary people hear about the Way and wander onto it and off it.",
    "Thoughtless people hear about the Way and make jokes about it.",
    "It wouldn’t be the Way if there weren’t jokes about it.",
    "So they say: The Way’s brightness looks like darkness; advancing on the Way feels like retreating; the plain Way seems hard going.",
    "The height of power seems a valley; the amplest power seems not enough; the firmest power seems feeble.",
    "Perfect whiteness looks dirty.",
    "The pure and simple looks chaotic.",
    "The great square has no corners.",
    "The great vessel is never finished.",
    "The great tone is barely heard.",
    "The great thought can’t be thought.",
    "The Way is hidden in its namelessness.",
    "But only the Way begins, sustains, fulfills.",
    "#### 42 ### Children of the Way  The Way bears one.",
    "The one bears two.",
    "The two bear three.",
    "The three bear the ten thousand things.",
    "The ten thousand things carry the yin on their shoulders and hold in their arms the yang, whose interplay of energy makes harmony.",
    "People despise orphans, widowers, outcasts.",
    "Yet that’s what kings and rulers call themselves.",
    "Whatever you lose, you’ve won.",
    "Whatever you win, you’ve lost.",
    "What others teach, I say too: violence and aggression destroy themselves.",
    "My teaching rests on that.",
    "Beginning with a pocket cosmology, this chapter demonstrates the “interplay of energy” of yin and yang by showing how low and high, winning and losing, destruction and self-destruction, reverse themselves, each turning into its seeming opposite.",
    "#### 43 ### Water and stone  What’s softest in the world rushes and runs over what’s hardest in the world.",
    "The immaterial enters the impenetrable.",
    "So I know the good in not doing.",
    "The wordless teaching, the profit in not doing— not many people understand it.",
    "#### 44 ### Fame and fortune  Which is nearer, name or self.",
    "Which is dearer, self or wealth.",
    "Which gives more pain, loss or gain.",
    "All you grasp will be thrown away.",
    "All you hoard will be utterly lost.",
    "Contentment keeps disgrace away.",
    "Restraint keeps you out of danger so you can go on for a long, long time.",
    "#### 45 ### Real power  What’s perfectly whole seems flawed, but you can use it forever.",
    "What’s perfectly full seems empty, but you can’t use it up.",
    "True straightness looks crooked.",
    "Great skill looks clumsy.",
    "Real eloquence seems to stammer.",
    "To be comfortable in the cold, keep moving; to be comfortable in the heat, hold still; to be comfortable in the world, stay calm and clear.",
    "#### 46 ### Wanting less  When the world’s on the Way, they use horses to haul manure.",
    "When the world gets off the Way, they breed warhorses on the common.",
    "The greatest evil: wanting more.",
    "The worst luck: discontent.",
    "Greed’s the curse of life.",
    "To know enough’s enough is enough to know.",
    "#### 47 ### Looking far  You don’t have to go out the door to know what goes on in the world.",
    "You don’t have to look out the window to see the way of heaven.",
    "The farther you go, the less you know.",
    "So the wise soul doesn’t go, but knows; doesn’t look, but sees; doesn’t do, but gets it done.",
    "We tend to expect great things from “seeing the world” and “getting experience.",
    "” A Roman poet remarked that travelers change their sky but not their soul.",
    "Other poets, untraveled and inexperienced, Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson, prove Lao Tzu’s point: it’s the inner eye that really sees the world.",
    "#### 48 ### Unlearning  Studying and learning daily you grow larger.",
    "Following the Way daily you shrink.",
    "You get smaller and smaller.",
    "So you arrive at not doing.",
    "You do nothing and nothing’s not done.",
    "To run things, don’t fuss with them.",
    "Nobody who fusses is fit to run things.",
    "The word _shi_ in the second stanza, my “fuss,” is troublesome to the translators.",
    "Carus’s quite legitimate translation of it is “diplomacy,” which would give a stanza I like very much:  To run things, be undiplomatic.",
    "No diplomat is fit to run things.",
    "#### 49 ### Trust and power  The wise have no mind of their own, finding it in the minds of ordinary people.",
    "They’re good to good people and they’re good to bad people.",
    "Power is goodness.",
    "They trust people of good faith and they trust people of bad faith.",
    "Power is trust.",
    "They mingle their life with the world, they mix their mind up with the world.",
    "Ordinary people look after them.",
    "Wise souls are children.",
    "The next to last line is usually read as saying that ordinary people watch and listen to wise people.",
    "But Lao Tzu has already told us that most of us wander on and off the Way and don’t know a sage from a sandpile.",
    "And surely the quiet Taoist is not a media pundit.",
    "Similarly, the last line is taken to mean that the wise treat ordinary people like children.",
    "This is patronizing, and makes hash out of the first verse.",
    "I read it to mean that the truly wise are looked after (or looked upon) like children because they’re trusting, unprejudiced, and don’t hold themselves above or apart from ordinary life.",
    "#### 50 ### Love of life  To look for life is to find death.",
    "The thirteen organs of our living are the thirteen organs of our dying.",
    "Why are the organs of our life where death enters us.",
    "Because we hold too hard to living.",
    "So I’ve heard if you live in the right way, when you cross country you needn’t fear to meet a mad bull or a tiger; when you’re in a battle you needn’t fear the weapons.",
    "The bull would find nowhere to jab its horns, the tiger nowhere to stick its claws, the sword nowhere for its point to go.",
    "Why.",
    "Because there’s nowhere in you for death to enter.",
    "#### 51 ### Nature, nurture  The Way bears them; power nurtures them; their own being shapes them; their own energy completes them.",
    "And not one of the ten thousand things fails to hold the Way sacred or to obey its power.",
    "Their reverence for the Way and obedience to its power are unforced and always natural.",
    "For the Way gives them life; its power nourishes them, mothers and feeds them, completes and matures them, looks after them, protects them.",
    "To have without possessing, do without claiming, lead without controlling: this is mysterious power.",
    "#### 52 ### Back to the beginning  The beginning of everything is the mother of everything.",
    "Truly to know the mother is to know her children, and truly to know the children is to turn back to the mother.",
    "The body comes to its ending but there is nothing to fear.",
    "Close the openings, shut the doors, and to the end of life nothing will trouble you.",
    "Open the openings, be busy with business, and to the end of life nothing can help you.",
    "Insight sees the insignificant.",
    "Strength knows how to yield.",
    "Use the way’s light, return to its insight, and so keep from going too far.",
    "That’s how to practice what’s forever.",
    "This chapter on the themes of return and centering makes circles within itself and throughout the book, returning to phrases from other poems, turning them round the center.",
    "A center which is everywhere, a circle whose circumference is infinite.",
    "#### 53 ### Insight  If my mind’s modest, I walk the great way.",
    "Arrogance is all I fear.",
    "The great way is low and plain, but people like shortcuts over the mountains.",
    "The palace is full of splendor and the fields are full of weeds and the granaries are full of nothing.",
    "People wearing ornaments and fancy clothes, carrying weapons, drinking a lot and eating a lot, having a lot of things, a lot of money: shameless thieves.",
    "Surely their way isn’t the way.",
    "So much for capitalism.",
    "#### 55 ### The sign of the mysterious  Being full of power is like being a baby.",
    "Scorpions don’t sting, tigers don’t attack, eagles don’t strike.",
    "Soft bones, weak muscles, but a firm grasp.",
    "Ignorant of the intercourse of man and woman, yet the baby penis is erect.",
    "True and perfect energy.",
    "All day long screaming and crying, but never getting hoarse.",
    "True and perfect harmony.",
    "To know harmony is to know what’s eternal.",
    "To know what’s eternal is enlightenment.",
    "Increase of life is full of portent: the strong heart exhausts the vital breath.",
    "The full-grown is on the edge of age.",
    "Not the Way.",
    "What’s not the Way soon dies.",
    "As a model for the Taoist, the baby is in many ways ideal: totally unaltruistic, not interested in politics, business, or the proprieties, weak, soft, and able to scream placidly for hours without wearing itself out (its parents are another matter).",
    "The baby’s unawareness of poisonous insects and carnivorous beasts means that such dangers simply do not exist for it.",
    "(Again, its parents are a different case.",
    ") As a metaphor of the Tao, the baby embodies the eternal beginning, the everspringing source.",
    "“We come, trailing clouds of glory,” Wordsworth says; and Hopkins, “There lives the dearest freshness deep down things.",
    "” No Peter Panish refusal to grow up is involved, no hunt for the fountain of youth.",
    "What is eternal _is_ forever young, never grows old.",
    "But we are not eternal.",
    "It is in this sense that I understand how the natural, inevitable cycle of youth, growth, mature vigor, age, and decay can be “not the Way.",
    "” The Way is more than the cycle of any individual life.",
    "We rise, flourish, fail.",
    "The Way never fails.",
    "We are waves.",
    "It is the sea.",
    "#### 54 ### Some rules  Well planted is not uprooted, well kept is not lost.",
    "The offerings of the generations to the ancestors will not cease.",
    "To follow the way yourself is real power.",
    "To follow it in the family is abundant power.",
    "To follow it in the community is steady power.",
    "To follow it in the whole country is lasting power.",
    "To follow it in the world is universal power.",
    "So in myself I see what self is, in my household I see what family is, in my town I see what community is, in my nation I see what a country is, in the world I see what is under heaven.",
    "How do I know the world is so.",
    "By this.",
    "I follow Waley's interpretation of this chapter.",
    "It is Tao that plants and keeps; the various kinds of power belong to Tao; and finally in myself I see the Tao of self, and so on.",
    "#### 56 ### Mysteries of power  Who knows doesn’t talk.",
    "Who talks doesn’t know.",
    "Closing the openings, shutting doors,  blunting edge, loosing bond, dimming light, be one with the dust of the way.",
    "So you come to the deep sameness.",
    "Then you can’t be controlled by love or by rejection.",
    "You can’t be controlled by profit or by loss.",
    "You can’t be controlled by praise or by humiliation.",
    "Then you have honor under heaven.",
    "#### 57 ### Being simple  Run the country by doing what’s expected.",
    "Win the war by doing the unexpected.",
    "Control the world by doing nothing.",
    "How do I know that.",
    "By this.",
    "The more restrictions and prohibitions in the world, the poorer people get.",
    "The more experts the country has the more of a mess it’s in.",
    "The more ingenious the skillful are, the more monstrous their inventions.",
    "The louder the call for law and order, the more the thieves and con men multiply.",
    "So a wise leader might say: I practice inaction, and the people look after themselves.",
    "I love to be quiet, and the people themselves find justice.",
    "I don’t do business, and the people prosper on their own.",
    "I don’t have wants, and the people themselves are uncut wood.",
    "A strong political statement of the central idea of _wu wei_ , not doing, inaction.",
    "My “monstrous” is literally “new.",
    "” New is strange, and strange is uncanny.",
    "New is bad.",
    "Lao Tzu is deeply and firmly against changing things, particularly in the name of progress.",
    "He would make an Iowa farmer look flighty.",
    "I don’t think he is exactly anti-intellectual, but he considers most uses of the intellect to be pernicious, and all plans for improving things to be disastrous.",
    "Yet he’s not a pessimist.",
    "No pessimist would say that people are able to look after themselves, be just, and prosper on their own.",
    "No anarchist can be a pessimist.",
    "Uncut wood—here likened to the human soul—the uncut, unearned, unshaped, unpolished, native, natural stuff is better than anything that can be made out of it.",
    "Anything done to it deforms and lessens it.",
    "Its potentiality is infinite.",
    "Its uses are trivial.",
    "#### 58 ### Living with change  When the government’s dull and confused, the people are placid.",
    "When the government’s sharp and keen, the people are discontented.",
    "Alas.",
    "misery lies under happiness, and happiness sits on misery, alas.",
    "Who knows where it will end.",
    "Nothing is certain.",
    "The normal changes into the monstrous, the fortunate into the unfortunate, and our bewilderment goes on and on.",
    "And so the wise shape without cutting, square without sawing, true without forcing.",
    "They are the light that does not shine.",
    "In the first verse, the words “dull and confused” and “sharp and keen” are, as Waley points out, the words used in chapter 20 to describe the Taoist and the non-Taoists.",
    "In the last verse most translators say the Taoist is square but doesn’t cut, shines but doesn’t dazzle.",
    "Waley says that this misses the point.",
    "The point is that Taoists gain their ends _without the use of means_.",
    "That is indeed a light that does not shine—an idea that must be pondered and brooded over.",
    "A small dark light.",
    "#### 59 ### Staying on the way  In looking after your life and following the way, gather spirit.",
    "Gather spirit early, and so redouble power, and so become invulnerable.",
    "Invulnerable, unlimited, you can do what you like with material things.",
    "But only if you hold to the Mother of things will you do it for long.",
    "Have deep roots, a strong trunk.",
    "Live long by looking long.",
    "#### 60 ### Staying put  Rule a big country the way you cook a small fish.",
    "If you keep control by following the Way, troubled spirits won’t act up.",
    "They won’t lose their immaterial strength, but they won’t harm people with it, nor will wise souls come to harm.",
    "And so, neither harming the other, these powers will come together in unity.",
    "Thomas Jefferson would have liked the first stanza.",
    "“Troubled spirits” are _kwei_ , ghosts, not bad in themselves but dangerous if they possess you.",
    "Waley reads the second stanza as a warning to believers in _Realpolitik_ : a ruler “possessed” by power harms both the people and his own soul.",
    "Taking it as counsel to the individual, it might mean that wise souls neither indulge nor repress the troubled spirits that may haunt them; rather, they let those spiritual energies be part of the power they find along the way.",
    "#### 61 ### Lying low  The polity of greatness runs downhill like a river to the sea, joining with everything, woman to everything.",
    "By stillness the woman may always dominate the man, lying quiet underneath him.",
    "So a great country submitting to small ones, dominates them; so small countries, submitting to a great one, dominate it.",
    "Lie low to be on top, be on top by lying low.",
    "#### 62 ### The gift of the way  The way is the hearth and home of the ten thousand things.",
    "Good souls treasure it, lost souls find shelter in it.",
    "Fine words are for sale, fine deeds go cheap; even worthless people can get them.",
    "So, at the coronation of the Son of Heaven when the Three Ministers take office, you might race out in a four-horse chariot to offer a jade screen; but wouldn’t it be better to sit still and let the Way be your offering.",
    "Why was the Way honored in the old days.",
    "Wasn’t it said: Seek, you’ll find it.",
    "Hide, it will shelter you.",
    "So it was honored under heaven.",
    "I think the line of thought throughout the poem has to do with true reward as opposed to dishonorable gain, true giving as opposed to fake goods.",
    "#### 63 ### Consider beginnings  Do without doing.",
    "Act without action.",
    "Savor the flavorless.",
    "Treat the small as large, the few as many.",
    "Meet injury with the power of goodness.",
    "Study the hard while it’s easy.",
    "Do big things while they’re small.",
    "The hardest jobs in the world start out easy, the great affairs of the world start small.",
    "So the wise soul, by never dealing with great things, gets great things done.",
    "Now, since taking things too lightly makes them worthless, and taking things too easy makes them hard, the wise soul, by treating the easy as hard, doesn’t find anything hard.",
    "Waley says that this charmingly complex chapter plays with two proverbs.",
    "“Requite injuries with good deeds” is the first.",
    "The word _te_ , here meaning goodness or good deeds, is the same word Lao Tzu uses for the Power of the Way.",
    "(“Power is goodness,” he says in chapter 49.",
    ") So, having neatly annexed the Golden Rule, he goes on to the proverb about “taking things too lightly” and plays paradox with it.",
    "#### 64 ### Mindful of little things  It’s easy to keep hold of what hasn’t stirred, easy to plan what hasn’t occurred.",
    "It’s easy to shatter delicate things, easy to scatter little things.",
    "Do things before they happen.",
    "Get them straight before they get mixed up.",
    "The tree you can’t reach your arms around grew from a tiny seedling.",
    "The nine-story tower rises from a heap of clay.",
    "The ten-thousand-mile journey begins beneath your foot.",
    "Do, and do wrong; Hold on, and lose.",
    "Not doing, the wise soul doesn’t do it wrong, and not holding on, doesn’t lose it.",
    "(In all their undertakings, it’s just as they’re almost finished that people go wrong.",
    "Mind the end as the beginning, then it won’t go wrong.",
    ")  That’s why the wise want not to want, care nothing for hard-won treasures, learn not to be learned, turn back to what people overlooked.",
    "They go along with things as they are, but don’t presume to act.",
    "#### 65 ### One power  Once upon a time those who ruled according to the Way didn’t use it to make people knowing but to keep them unknowing.",
    "People get hard to manage when they know too much.",
    "Whoever rules by intellect is a curse upon the land.",
    "Whoever rules by ignorance is a blessing on it.",
    "To understand these things is to have a pattern and a model, and to understand the pattern and the model is mysterious power.",
    "Mysterious power goes deep.",
    "It reaches far.",
    "It follows things back, clear back to the great oneness.",
    "Where shall we find a ruler wise enough to know what to teach and what to withhold.",
    "“Once upon a time,” maybe, in the days of myth and legend, as a pattern, a model, an ideal.",
    "The knowledge and the ignorance or unknowing Lao Tzu speaks of may or may not refer to what we think of as education.",
    "In the last stanza, by power he evidently does not mean political power at all, but something vastly different, a unity with the power of the Tao itself.",
    "This is a _mystical_ statement about _government_ —and in our minds those two realms are worlds apart.",
    "I cannot make the leap between them.",
    "I can only ponder it.",
    "#### 66 ### Lowdown  Lakes and rivers are lords of the hundred valleys.",
    "Why.",
    "Because they’ll go lower.",
    "So they’re the lords of the hundred valleys.",
    "Just so, a wise soul, wanting to be above other people, talks to them from below and to guide them follows them.",
    "And so the wise soul predominates without dominating, and leads without misleading.",
    "And people don’t get tired of enjoying and praising one who, not competing, has in all the world no competitor.",
    "One of the things I love in Lao Tzu is his good cheer, as in this poem, which while giving good counsel is itself a praise and enjoyment of the spirit of yin, the water-soul that yields, follows, eludes, and leads on, dancing in the hundred valleys.",
    "#### 67 ### Three treasures  Everybody says my way is great but improbable.",
    "All greatness is improbable.",
    "What’s probable is tedious and petty.",
    "I have three treasures.",
    "I keep and treasure them.",
    "The first, mercy, the second, moderation, the third, modesty.",
    "If you’re merciful you can be brave, if you’re moderate you can be generous, and if you don’t presume to lead you can lead the high and mighty.",
    "But to be brave without compassion, or generous without self-restraint, or to take the lead, is fatal.",
    "Compassion wins the battle and holds the fort; it is the bulwark set around those heaven helps.",
    "The first two verses of this chapter are a joy to me.",
    "The three final verses are closely connected in thought to the next two chapters, which may be read as a single meditation on mercy, moderation, and modesty, on the use of strength, on victory and defeat.",
    "#### 68 ### Heaven’s lead  The best captain doesn’t rush in front.",
    "The fiercest fighter doesn’t bluster.",
    "The big winner isn’t competing.",
    "The best boss takes a low footing.",
    "This is the power of noncompetition.",
    "This is the right use of ability.",
    "To follow heaven’s lead has always been the best way.",
    "#### 69 ### Using mystery  The expert in warfare says: Rather than dare make the attack I’d take the attack; rather than dare advance an inch I’d retreat a foot.",
    "It’s called marching without marching, rolling up your sleeves without flexing your muscles, being armed without weapons, giving the attacker no opponent.",
    "Nothing’s worse than attacking what yields.",
    "To attack what yields is to throw away the prize.",
    "So, when matched armies meet, the one who comes to grief is the true victor.",
    "A piece of sound tactical advice (practiced by the martial arts, such as Aikido, and by underground resistance and guerrilla forces), which leads to a profound moral warning.",
    "The prize thrown away by the aggressor is compassion.",
    "The yielder, the griever, the mourner, keeps that prize.",
    "The game is loser take all.",
    "#### 70 ### Being obscure  My words are so easy to understand, so easy to follow,  and yet nobody in the world understands or follows them.",
    "Words come from an ancestry, deeds from a mastery: when these are unknown, so am I.",
    "In my obscurity is my value.",
    "That’s why the wise wear their jade under common clothes.",
    "#### 71 ### The sick mind  To know without knowing is best.",
    "Not knowing without knowing it is sick.",
    "To be sick of sickness is the only cure.",
    "The wise aren’t sick.",
    "They’re sick of sickness, so they’re well.",
    "What you know without knowing you know it is the right kind of knowledge.",
    "Any other kind (conviction, theory, dogmatic belief, opinion) isn’t the right kind, and if you don’t know that, you’ll lose the Way.",
    "This chapter is an example of exactly what Lao Tzu was talking about in the last one—obscure clarity, well-concealed jade.",
    "#### 72 ### The right fear  When we don’t fear what we should fear we are in fearful danger.",
    "We ought not to live in narrow houses, we ought not to do stupid work.",
    "If we don’t accept stupidity we won’t act stupidly.",
    "So, wise souls know but don’t show themselves, look after but don’t prize themselves, letting the one go, keeping the other.",
    "#### 73 ### Daring to do  Brave daring leads to death.",
    "Brave caution leads to life.",
    "The choice can be the right one or the wrong one.",
    "Who will interpret the judgment of heaven.",
    "Even the wise soul finds it hard.",
    "The way of heaven doesn’t compete yet wins handily, doesn’t speak yet answers fully, doesn’t summon yet attracts.",
    "It acts perfectly easily.",
    "The net of heaven is vast, vast, wide-meshed, yet misses nothing.",
    "#### 74 ### The Lord of Slaughter  When normal, decent people don’t fear death, how can you use death to frighten them.",
    "Even when they have a normal fear of death, who of us dare take and kill the one who doesn’t.",
    "When people are normal and decent and death-fearing, there’s always an executioner.",
    "To take the place of that executioner is to take the place of the great carpenter.",
    "People who cut the great carpenter’s wood seldom get off with their hands unhurt.",
    "To Lao Tzu, not to fear dying and not to fear killing are equally unnatural and antisocial.",
    "Who are we to forestall the judgment of heaven or nature, to usurp the role of “the executioner”.",
    "“The Lord of Slaughter” is Waley’s grand translation.",
    "#### 75 ### Greed  People are starving.",
    "The rich gobble taxes, that’s why people are starving.",
    "People rebel.",
    "The rich oppress them, that’s why people rebel.",
    "People hold life cheap.",
    "The rich make it too costly, that’s why people hold it cheap.",
    "But those who don’t live for the sake of living are worth more than the wealth-seekers.",
    "How many hundreds of years ago was this book written.",
    "And yet still this chapter must be written in the present tense.",
    "#### 76 ### Hardness  Living people are soft and tender.",
    "Corpses are hard and stiff.",
    "The ten thousand things, the living grass, the trees, are soft, pliant.",
    "Dead, they’re dry and brittle.",
    "So hardness and stiffness go with death; tenderness, softness, go with life.",
    "And the hard sword fails, the stiff tree’s felled.",
    "The hard and great go under.",
    "The soft and weak stay up.",
    "In an age when hardness is supposed to be the essence of strength, and even the beauty of women is reduced nearly to the bone, I welcome this reminder that tanks and tombstones are not very adequate role models, and that to be alive is to be vulnerable.",
    "#### 77 ### The bow  The Way of heaven is like a bow bent to shoot: its top end brought down, its lower end raised up.",
    "It brings the high down, lifts the low, takes from those who have, gives to those who have not.",
    "Such is the Way of heaven, taking from people who have, giving to people who have not.",
    "Not so the human way: it takes from those who have not to fill up those who have.",
    "Who has enough to fill up everybody.",
    "Only those who have the Way.",
    "So the wise do without claiming, achieve without asserting, wishing not to show their worth.",
    "#### 78 ### Paradoxes  Nothing in the world is as soft, as weak, as water; nothing else can wear away the hard, the strong, and remain unaltered.",
    "Soft overcomes hard, weak overcomes strong.",
    "Everybody knows it, nobody uses the knowledge.",
    "So the wise say: By bearing common defilements you become a sacrificer at the altar of earth; by bearing common evils you become a lord of the world.",
    "Right words sound wrong.",
    "#### 79 ### Keeping the contract  After a great enmity is settled some enmity always remains.",
    "How to make peace.",
    "Wise souls keep their part of the contract and don’t make demands on others.",
    "People whose power is real fulfill their obligations; people whose power is hollow insist on their claims.",
    "The Way of heaven plays no favorites.",
    "It stays with the good.",
    "This chapter is equally relevant to private relationships and to political treaties.",
    "Its realistic morality is based on a mystical perception of the fullness of the Way.",
    "#### 80 ### Freedom  Let there be a little country without many people.",
    "Let them have tools that do the work of ten or a hundred, and never use them.",
    "Let them be mindful of death and disinclined to long journeys.",
    "They’d have ships and carriages, but no place to go.",
    "They’d have armor and weapons, but no parades.",
    "Instead of writing, they might go back to using knotted cords.",
    "They’d enjoy eating, take pleasure in clothes, be happy with their houses, devoted to their customs.",
    "Waley says this endearing and enduring vision “can be understood in the past, present, or future tense, as the reader desires.",
    "” This is always true of the vision of the golden age, the humane society.",
    "Christian or Cartesian dualism, the division of spirit or mind from the material body and world, existed long before Christianity or Descartes and was never limited to Western thought (though it is the “craziness” or “sickness” that many people under Western domination see in Western civilization).",
    "Lao Tzu thinks the materialistic dualist, who tries to ignore the body and live in the head, and the religious dualist, who despises the body and lives for a reward in heaven, are both dangerous and in danger.",
    "So, enjoy your life, he says; live in your body, you are your body; where else is there to go.",
    "Heaven and earth are one.",
    "As you walk the streets of your town you walk on the Way of heaven.",
    "#### 81 ### Telling it true  True words aren’t charming, charming words aren’t true.",
    "Good people aren’t contentious, contentious people aren’t good.",
    "People who know aren’t learned, learned people don’t know.",
    "Wise souls don’t hoard; the more they do for others the more they have, the more they give the richer they are.",
    "The Way of heaven profits without destroying.",
    "Doing without outdoing is the Way of the wise.",
    "The next little country might be so close the people could hear cocks crowing and dogs barking there, but they’d get old and die without ever having been there.",
    "## NOTES ## Concerning This Version This is a rendition, not a translation.",
    "I do not know any Chinese.",
    "I could approach the text at all only because Paul Carus, in his 1898 translation of the _Tao Te Ching_ , printed the Chinese text with each character followed by a transliteration and a translation.",
    "My gratitude to him is unending.",
    "To have the text thus made accessible was not only to have a Rosetta Stone for the book itself, but also to have a touchstone for comparing other English translations one with another.",
    "If I could focus on which word the translators were interpreting, I could begin to understand why they made the choice they did.",
    "I could compare various interpretations and see why they varied so tremendously; could see how much explanation, sometimes how much bias, was included in the translation; could discover for myself that several English meanings might lead me back to the same Chinese word.",
    "And, finally, for all my ignorance of the language, I could gain an intuition of the style, the gait and cadence, of the original, necessary to my ear and conscience if I was to try to reproduce it in English.",
    "Without the access to the text that the Carus edition gave me, I would have been defeated by the differences among the translations, and could never have thought of following them as guides towards a version of my own.",
    "As it was, working from Carus’s text, I learned how to let them lead me into it, always using their knowledge, their scholarship, their decisions, as my light in darkness.",
    "When you try to follow the Way, even if you wander off it all the time, good things happen though you do not deserve them.",
    "My work on the _Tao Te Ching_ was very wandering indeed.",
    "I started in my twenties with a few chapters.",
    "Every decade or so I’d do another bit, and tell myself I’d sit down and really get to it, some day.",
    "The undeserved good thing that happened was that a true and genuine scholar of ancient Chinese and of Lao Tzu, Dr.",
    "J.",
    "P.",
    "Seaton of the University of North Carolina, saw some of my versions of bits of the _Tao Te_ _Ching_ (scurvily quoted without attribution by myself).",
    "He reprinted them with honor, and asked me for more.",
    "I do not think he knew what he was getting into.",
    "Of his invaluable teaching, his encouragement, his generosity, I can say only what Lao Tzu says at the end of the book:  Wise souls don’t hoard; the more they do for others the more they have, the more they give the richer they are.",
    "## Sources Though the _Tao Te Ching_ has been translated into English very much more often than any other Chinese classic, indeed almost overwhelmingly often, it wasn’t easy to get hold of more than a few of these versions until quite recently.",
    "Carus’s word-for-word Chinese-to-English was endlessly valuable to me, but his actual translation wasn’t very satisfactory.",
    "“Reason” as a translation of Tao did not ring true.",
    "I always looked at any translation of the book I found and had a go at it.",
    "The language of some was so obscure as to make me feel the book must be beyond Western comprehension.",
    "(James Legge’s version was one of these, though I did find the title for a book of mine, _The Lathe of Heaven_ , in Legge.",
    "Years later, Joseph Needham, the great scholar of Chinese science and technology, wrote to tell me in the kindest, most unreproachful fashion that Legge was a bit off on that one; when _Chuang Tzu_ was written the lathe hadn’t been invented.",
    ") Listed roughly in the order of their usefulness to me, these are the translations that I collected over the years and came to trust in one way or another and to use as my exemplars and guides: Paul Carus.",

    "Most of the translations were based on the interpretations of commentators, but you chiefly took its interpretation from your own insight.",
    "so the translation could be very close to the original text even without knowledge of the words.",
    "” This is true of Bynner’s very free, poetic “American Version,” and its truth helped give me the courage to work on my own American Version fifty years later.",
    "I did not refer often to Bynner while I worked, because his style is very different from mine and his vivid language might have controlled my own rather than freeing it.",
    "But I am most grateful to him.",
    "I started out using translations by Stephen Mitchell and Chang Chung-yuan, but found them not useful.",
    "Since I began working seriously on this version so many _Tao Te Ching_ s have appeared or reappeared that one begins to wonder if Lao Tzu has more translators than he has readers.",
    "I have looked hopefully into many, but none of the new versions seems to improve in any way on Waley, Henricks, Lau, or Feng-English, and many of them blur the language into dullness and vagueness.",
    "Lao Tzu is tough-minded.",
    "He is tender-minded.",
    "He is never, under any circumstances, squashy-minded.",
    "By confusing mysticism with imprecision, such versions betray the spirit of the book and its marvelously pungent, laconic, beautiful language.",
    "^1 1.",
    "lf you want to know more about Taoism, or would like some help and guidance in reading the _Tao Te Ching_ , the best, soundest, clearest introduction and guide is still Holmes Welch’s _Taoism: The Parting of the Way_ (Boston: Beacon Press, 1957).",
    "## Notes on Some Choices of Wording For _tao_ , I mostly use “Way,” sometimes “way,” depending on context.",
    "“Way” in my text always represents the character _tao_.",
    "I consistently render the character _te_ as “power.",
    "” “Virtue” ( _virtus, vertú_ ) in its old sense of the inherent quality and strength of a thing or person is far closer to the mark, but that sense is pretty well lost.",
    "Applied obsessively to the virginity or monogamy of women, the word lost its own virtue.",
    "When used of persons it now almost always has a smirk or a sneer in it.",
    "This is a shame.",
    "Lao Tzu’s “Power is goodness” makes precisely the identification we used to make in the word “virtue.",
    "” “Power,” on the other hand, is a powerful word, almost a mana-word for us.",
    "It is also a very slippery one, with many connotations.",
    "To identify it with goodness takes a special, Taoistic definition of it as a property of—the virtue of—the Way.",
    "The phrase _t’ien hsia_ , literally “under heaven,” occurs many times throughout the text.",
    "More often than not I render it as “the world.",
    "” It is often translatable as “the Empire”—which after all meant the world, to Lao Tzu’s contemporaries.",
    "I avoid this, in order to avoid historical specificity; but often _t’ien hsia_ indubitably means one’s country, one’s land, as in chapter 26.",
    "Elsewhere I call it the public good, the commonwealth, or the common good, and sometimes I render it literally.",
    "The phrase _wan wuh_ , occurring very frequently, means the material world, all beings, everything.",
    "I often use the traditional literal translation, “the ten thousand things,” because it’s lively and concrete, but at times I say “everything” or “the things of this world.",
    "” I use “wise soul” or “the wise” for the several words and phrases usually rendered as Sage, Wise Man, Saint, Great Man, and so on, and I avoid the pronoun usually associated with these terms.",
    "I wanted to make a version that doesn’t limit wisdom to males, and doesn’t give the impression that a follower of the Tao has to be a professional, full-time Holier-than-Thou who lives up above snowline.",
    "Unimportant, uneducated, untrained men and women can be wise souls.",
    "(I thought of using _mensch_.",
    ") With the same intention, I often use the plural pronoun where other translations use the singular, to avoid unnecessary gendering and to keep from suggesting the idea of uniqueness, singularity.",
    "I appreciate the Chinese language for making such choices available.",
    "Certain obscure passages and verses that change or obstruct the sense of the poems may be seen as errors or interpolations by copyists.",
    "I decided to eject some of them.",
    "My authority for doing so is nil—a poet’s judgment that “this doesn’t belong here.",
    "” It takes nerve to drop a line that Waley has left in.",
    "My version is openly dependent on the judgment of the scholars.",
    "But my aim was to make aesthetic, intellectual, and spiritual sense, and I felt that efforts to treat material extraneous to the text as integral to it weaken its integrity.",
    "Anyhow, rejects are discussed and printed in the commentary on the page with the poem, or in the Notes.",
    "_The Titles of the Poems_ : Carus is one of the few translators to use titles; they are in both his Chinese text and his translation.",
    "I follow his version sometimes, and sometimes invent my own.",
    "## The Two Texts of the Tao Te Ching We now have two versions of the _Tao Te Ching_ : the texts that have been standard since the third century CE, and the _Ma wang tui_ texts of the mid-first century CE, not discovered till 1973.",
    "They differ in many details, but in only one major respect: the order of the two books that constitute the text.",
    "The three words _tao te ching_ , put into English without syntactical connection, are “way power classic.",
    "” The usual interpretation gives the meaning of this title as something on the order of “the classic [text] about the way and [its] power.",
    "” The two books are titled (in some versions) Tao, “The Way,” and _Te_ , “The Power.",
    "” (I personally find that the poems do not consistently reflect that division of subject-matter.",
    ") In the _Ma wang tui_ , the Power comes before the Way.",
    "I keep the standard order, in which _tao_ precedes _te_ , and the famous stanza about the go-able way and the namable name is the first chapter, not the thirtyeighth.",
    "Where there are differences in wording, I follow sometimes the standard text, sometimes Robert G.",
    "Henricks’s translation of the _Ma wang tui_ , whichever seemed more useful.",
    "## Notes on the Chapters CHAPTER 1 Here, for the words in the third verse that I render “what it wants,” I use the _Ma wang tui_ text.",
    "The words in the standard text mean boundaries, or limits, or outcomes.",
    "This version seems to follow more comprehensibly from the preceding lines.",
    "And yet the idea of what can be delimited or made manifest is relevant.",
    "In the last verse, the two “whose identity is mystery” may be understood to be the hidden, the unnameable, the limitless vision of the freed soul—and the manifest, the nameable, the field of vision limited by our wants.",
    "But the endlessness of all that is, and the limitation of mortal bodily life, are the same, and their sameness is the key to the door.",
    "CHAPTER 5 As I said above, in a few of the poems I leave out lines which I find weaken the coherence of the text to the point that I believe them to be a long-ago reader’s marginal notes which got incorporated in later copyings.",
    "My authority for these omissions is strictly personal and aesthetic.",
    "Here I omit the last two lines.",
    "Translations of them vary greatly; my version is:  Mere talk runs dry.",
    "Best keep to the center.",
    "CHAPTER 12 There are times Lao Tzu sounds very like Henry David Thoreau, but Lao Tzu was kinder.",
    "When Thoreau says to distrust any enterprise that requires new clothes, I distrust him.",
    "He is macho, flaunting his asceticism.",
    "Lao Tzu knows that getting all entangled with the external keeps us from the eternal, but (see chapter 80) he also understands that sometimes people like to get dressed up.",
    "CHAPTER 13 _T’ien hsia_ , “under heaven,” _i.",
    "e_.",
    "the Empire, or the world: here I render it as “the public good,” “the commonwealth,” and “the body politic.",
    "” J.",
    "P.",
    "Seaton comments: “When Lao Tzu mentions ‘the Empire’ or ‘all under heaven,’ he does so with the assumption that all his readers know that it is a commonwealth where only the ruler who rules by virtue of virtue alone is legitimate.",
    "” CHAPTERS 17, 18, AND 19 Henricks considers these three chapters to belong together.",
    "The last two lines of 19 are usually printed as the first two lines of 20, but Henricks thinks they belong here, and I follow him.",
    "In 18, line 6, the words _hsiao tzu_ are traditionally translated as “filial piety and paternal affection,” a Confucian ideal.",
    "In that chapter Lao Tzu cites these dutiful families as a symptom of social disorder.",
    "But in chapter 19, line 4, _hsiao tzu_ appears as the good that will result when people cease being moralistic.",
    "Unable to reconcile these contradictory usages, and feeling that Lao Tzu was far more likely to use Confucian language satirically than straightforwardly, I fudged the translation in chapter 19, calling it “family feeling.",
    "” Evidently we aren’t the only society or generation to puzzle over what a family is and ought to be.",
    "Sometimes I translate the characters _su_ and _p_ ’ _u_ with such words as _simple, natural_.",
    "Though the phrase “the uncarved block” has become familiar to many, yet metaphor may distance ideas and weaken a direct statement.",
    "But sometimes, as here, I use the traditional metaphors, because the context so clearly implies knowing something as an artist knows her materials, keeping hold on something solid.",
    "CHAPTER 20 The standard texts ask what’s the difference between _wei_ and _o_ , which might be translated “yes” and “yessir.",
    "” The _Ma wang tui_ has _wei_ and _ho_ : “yes” and “no.",
    "” This is parallel with the next line (“good and bad” in the standard text, “beautiful and ugly” in the _Ma wang tui_ ).",
    "Here’s a case where the older text surely is correct, the later ones corrupt.",
    "In the first two lines of the second verse, the _Ma wang tui_ text is perfectly clear: “A person whom everyone fears ought to be feared.",
    "” The standard text is strange, obscure: “What the people fear must be feared.",
    "” Yet the next lines follow from it as they don’t from the _Ma wang tui;_ and after much pondering I followed the standard text.",
    "CHAPTER 23 In the second verse the word _shih_ , “loss,” gives trouble to all the translators.",
    "Waley calls it “the reverse of the power” and “inefficacy,” and Waley’s interpretations are never to be ignored.",
    "All the same, I decided to take it not as the opposite of the Way and the power, but as a kind of shadow-Way.",
    "Identify yourself with loss, failure, the obscure, the unpossessible, and you’ll be at home even there.",
    "CHAPTER 24 My version of the first four lines of the second verse doesn’t follow any of the scholarly translations, and is quite unjustified, but at least, unlike them, it makes sense without horrible verbal contortions.",
    "CHAPTER 25 In all the texts, the fourth verse reads:  So they say: “The Way is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and the king is great.",
    "Four greatnesses in the world, and the king is one of them.",
    "” Yet in the next verse, which is the same series in reverse order, instead of “the king” it’s “the people” or “humanity.",
    "” I think a Confucian copyist slipped the king in.",
    "The king garbles the sense of the poem and goes against the spirit of the book.",
    "I dethroned him.",
    "The last words of the chapter, _tzu jan_ , which I render “what is,” bear many interpretations.",
    "Waley translates them as “the Self-So,” glossing them as “the unconditioned” or “what is so of itself”; Henricks, “what is so on its own”; Lau, “that which is naturally so”; Gibbs-Cheng, “Nature”; Feng-English, “what is natural”; Lafargue, “things as they are.",
    "” I came out closest to Lafargue in this case.",
    "CHAPTER 26 I follow the _Ma wang tui_ text for the third verse, which fits the theme much better than the non-sequitur standard text, “Amid fine sights they sit calm and aloof.",
    "” The syntax of the _Ma wang tui_ also clarifies the last verse, relating it to the last verse of chapter 13.",
    "CHAPTER 27 The first two lines of the third verse say that the not-good are the _t’zu_ : “the capital” (Carus), or “the charge” (Feng-English), or “the stock in trade” (Waley), or “the raw material” (Henricks) of the good.",
    "Lafargue has “the less excellent are material for the excellent,” and Gibbs-Cheng, “mediocre people have the potential to be good people.",
    "” The latter two interpretations seemed the most useful to me.",
    "And so I call these makings, this raw material, “a student”—somebody learning to be or know better.",
    "The last lines of the second and third verses are translated in wildly various ways; my “hidden light” and “deep mystery” are justified if, as I believe, Lao Tzu is signaling that his apparently simple statements have complex implications and need thinking about.",
    "Of course, this is true of everything in the book.",
    "CHAPTER 28 “The natural” and “natural wood” are the same word, _p_ ’ _u_ , which I talked about in the note to chapter 19.",
    "Given the amount of cutting up and carving that goes on in the last verse (which seems a kind of footnote to the first three), we really seem to be talking about wood.",
    "Chinese lends itself to puns, and this last verse is rife with them.",
    "Waley says that _ch’i_ (“useful things”) can mean “vessels” or “vassals,” and _chih_ can mean “carving” or “governing.",
    "” A great government wouldn’t chop and hack at human nature, trying to make leaders out of sow’s ears.",
    "But the paradox of the last two lines surely exceeds any single interpretation.",
    "CHAPTER 29 The phrase _t’ien hsia_ occurs only in the first verse, where I translate it “the world.",
    "” I begin the second verse with the literal translation of it, “under heaven.",
    "” I wanted the phrase in the poem as a reminder that the world of these extremes—of hot and cold, weakness and strength, gain and loss—is the sacred object, the place under heaven.",
    "CHAPTER 31 I have omitted certain lines included by the translators who are my sources and guides.",
    "In all the texts, the second verse begins:  A courteous person in peacetime honors the left, in wartime, the right.",
    "And the last verse begins:  In celebrations the left is the place of honor, in mourning the right is the place of honor: so lesser officers stand on the left, the generalissimo on the right, just as they would at a funeral.",
    "I consider these passages to be commentaries or marginal glosses that got copied into the text.",
    "J.",
    "P.",
    "Seaton says, “What were once supports by analogy to common ceremonial practice are now relevant only to the historian.",
    "” Here they confuse the clear, powerful statement that culminates in the last four lines.",
    "The confusion already existed when the _Ma wang tui_ version was written, and there seems to be no way of sorting it out now except by radical surgery.",
    "CHAPTER 33 This chapter sounds like Polonius, incontrovertible but banal, until the last verse, which is a doozer.",
    "Here are some other versions of the last six words, _Sss erh pu wang che shou:_  Carus (word for word): “[Who] dies / yet / not / perishes, / the-one / islong-lived [immortal].",
    "” Carus’s free translation: “One who may die but does not perish has life everlasting.",
    "” Waley: “When one dies one is not lost; there is no other longevity.",
    "” Feng-English: “To die but not to perish is to be eternally present.",
    "” Henricks: “To die but not be forgotten—that’s [true] long life.",
    "” Bynner: “Vitality cleaves to the marrow / Leaving death behind.",
    "” Lafargue: “One who dies and does not perish is truly long-lived.",
    "” Gibbs-Cheng: “One who dies yet still remains has longevity.",
    "” Lau: “He who lives out his days has had a long life.",
    "” Under J.",
    "P.",
    "Seaton’s guidance I finally came to feel that I had a handle on the line, and that Lau’s rendition was the most useful.",
    "One thing is certain, Lao Tzu is not saying that immortality or even longevity is desirable.",
    "The religion called Taoism has spent much imagination on ways to prolong life interminably or gain immortality, and the mythologized Lao Tzu was supposed to have run Methuselah a close race; but the Lao Tzu who wrote this had no truck with such notions.",
    "CHAPTER 36 _Wei ming_ —this phrase in the first line of the second verse (and the chapter title)—is tricky:  Carus (word for word): “the secret’s / explanation”; Carus’s free translation: “explanation [ i.",
    "e.",
    ", enlightenment] of the secret”  Feng-English: “perception of the nature of things” Gibbs-Cheng: “wonderfully minute and obscure, yet brilliant” Lafargue: “subtle clarity” Henricks: “subtle light” Bynner: “a man with insight” Waley: “dimming one’s light” _Ming_ is “light” or “enlightenment.",
    "” Waley explains that _wei_ means obscure because very small, and also obscure because dark.",
    "I use this second meaning to make an oxymoron.",
    "CHAPTER 37 The words in the first verse I translate as “the nameless, the natural” and in the next verse as “the unnamed, the unshapen” are the same four words: _wu ming chih p’u;_ more literally, “the naturalness of the unnamed.",
    "” “The unnamed” is a key phrase in the first chapter and elsewhere, as is “not wanting,” “unwanting.",
    "” _P_ ’ _u_ is the natural, the uncut wood, or, as Waley glosses it here, “uncarvedwood quality.",
    "” CHAPTER 38 The series here is of familiar Confucian principles: _jen, li, i_ —“good, humane, human-hearted, altruistic”; “righteous, moral, ethical”; “laws, rites, rules, law and order.",
    "” But Lao Tzu reverses and subverts the Confucian priorities.",
    "_Chien shih_ in the fourth verse is “premature knowledge” in Carus and “foreknowledge” in Lau, Henricks, and Waley (who explains it as part of Confucian doctrine).",
    "Henricks interprets it as having “one’s mind made up before one enters a new situation about what is ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ and ‘proper’ and ‘acceptable’ and so on.",
    "” Prejudice, that is, or opinion.",
    "Buddhists and Taoists agree in having a very low opinion of opinion.",
    "CHAPTER 39 _Yi_ , “one, the one, unity, singleness, integrity,” is here translated as “whole, wholeness.",
    "” Waley explains the last two verses as comments on the first three, but their relevance is pretty tenuous.",
    "The last verse is very difficult and the translations are various and ingenious.",
    "Henricks reads the _Ma wang tui_ text of the first two lines of it as meaning “too many carriages is the same as no carriage,” and I picked up on the idea of multiplicity as opposed to the singleness or wholeness spoken of in the first verses.",
    "The meaning of the lines about jade seems to be anybody’s guess.",
    "CHAPTER 41 I moved the line about perfect whiteness down to keep the three lines about power together, in parallel structure with the three lines about the Way.",
    "In the last line of the second verse (and in chapters 21 and 35) I translate _hsiang_ as “thought.",
    "” The word connotes “form, shape, image, idea” Waley explains it as the form which is formless, the Tao which can’t be tao’d.",
    "CHAPTER 42 In the sixth line, does the word _fu_ mean “carry on one’s back” or “turn one’s back on”.",
    "Lafargue is the only translator I found that made the second choice.",
    "I don’t follow him because I don’t think the “ten thousand things” would or can make the mistake of turning their backs on the yin to embrace only yang.",
    "(But a great many of us do make that mistake, which is why Lao Tzu keeps reminding us to value yin, the soft, the dark, the weak, earth, water, the Mother, the Valley.",
    ") Lafargue’s reading, however, lets the next stanza follow more coherently— orphans, the bereaved, the outcast are what we turn our backs on; winning is yang, losing is yin.",
    "Through loss we win.",
    "The last stanza is uncharacteristic in its didactic tone and in assimilating the teaching to a tradition.",
    "Lao Tzu usually cites “what others teach” only to dissociate himself from it.",
    "I was inclined to dismiss it as a marginal note by someone who was teaching and annotating the text.",
    "But J.",
    "P.",
    "Seaton, who does teach the text, persuaded me to keep it in the body of the poem, saying, “It’s a message that for all its flat moralism does connect Taoism to Confucianism and even to Buddhism with a single solid thread—averting a hundred holy wars, if nothing else.",
    "” CHAPTER 44 The intense, succinct, beautiful language of the first verses of a poem is sometimes followed by a verse or two in a more didactic tone, smaller in scope, and far more prosaic.",
    "I believe some of these verses are additions, comments, and examples, copied into the manuscripts so long ago that they became holy writ.",
    "They usually have their own charm and validity, but—as here, and in chapter 39 and other places—they bring a tremendous statement down to a rather commonplace ending.",
    "But then, Lao Tzu values the commonplace.",
    "CHAPTER 47 The last line, literally “not do, yet accomplish,” is a direct statement of one of the fundamental themes of the book.",
    "When I came up with a slightly mealy version of it (“doesn’t do, but it’s done”) J.",
    "P.",
    "Seaton reminded me that “doing without doing is doing, not not doing.",
    "” CHAPTER 48 _Shi_ (my “fuss,” Carus’s “diplomacy”) is translated by Lafargue as “work,” by Lau as “meddling,” by Waley and Feng-English as “interference,” by Henricks as “concern,” by Gibbs-Cheng as “act for gain.",
    "” CHAPTER 49 Following some of Carus’s interpretations, the first lines of the third verse might be read, “Wise souls live in the world carefully, handling it carefully, making their mind universal.",
    "” I can’t make much sense of any of the other versions except Henricks’s beautiful reading:  As for the Sage’s presence in the world, he is one with it.",
    "And with the world he merges his mind.",
    "CHAPTER 50 Those who read _shih yu san_ as “thirteen,” rather than as “three out of ten,” make better sense of the difficult first verse.",
    "The thirteen “companions of life” (Waley, Henricks), which I translate “organs,” may be physical, the limbs and passages and cavities of the body—or physio/psychological, the emotions and sensations.",
    "My “mad bull” occurs variously as a rhinoceros and a wild buffalo.",
    "The idea seems to be a big irritable animal with horns.",
    "My “live in the right way” is literally “take care of your life,” or “hold on to your life.",
    "” The context indicates care without anxiety, holding without grasping.",
    "I read the poem as saying that if you can take life as it comes, it doesn’t come at you as your enemy.",
    "Lao Tzu’s “nowhere for death to enter” isn’t a promise of invulnerability or immortality; his concern is how to live rightly, how to “live till you die.",
    "” CHAPTER 52 The last two lines of the first verse are the same as the last two lines of chapter 16.",
    "I wonder if some of these repetitions were insertions by people studying and copying the book, who were reminded of one poem by another and noted down the relevant lines.",
    "They are indeed relevant here, but they don’t fit with perfect inevitability, as they do in chapter 16.",
    "This is of course a purely aesthetic judgment, subject to destruction by scholarship at any moment.",
    "CHAPTER 54 Gibbs and Cheng, finding both the language and the message “discordant with the teachings of Lao Tzu,” won’t even discuss this chapter.",
    "Waley’s reading saves it, but the listing “self, family, community, country, empire/world” (a conventional series in ancient Chinese thought), and the list of rules and results is uncharacteristically mechanical.",
    "Though he uses many commonplaces, familiar phrases, rhymed sayings, and so on, Lao Tzu’s thought and language are usually more unconventional and unpredictable than this.",
    "CHAPTER 56 Another repetition: the first four lines of the second verse are the same as the second verse of chapter 4.",
    "They carry a different weight here.",
    "I vary my translation of them in the fourth line to make it connect to the next.",
    "_Hsuan t’ung_ , “the deep sameness”: _hsuan_ is “deep” or “mysterious”; _t’ung_ is variously translated “identification,” “oneness,” “sameness,” “merging,” “leveling,” “assimilation.",
    "” It is an important theme, met with before in chapter 49.",
    "CHAPTER 57 The phrase “How do I know.",
    "By this,” has become a kind of tag by its third repetition; but as Waley points out, it still implies intuitive knowing, beyond reason—knowing the way.",
    "The words I translate “experts” literally mean “sharp weapons,” but the term implies “pundits, know-it-alls.",
    "” I was tempted to say “smart bombs,” which is too cute and topical, but which would certainly lead neatly to the next lines.",
    "CHAPTER 58 Waley points out that words in the last verse, with such meanings as “square, right, angular,” are typical Confucian virtues.",
    "Henricks remarks that all these words and operations refer to carpentry.",
    "The verse is about how to cut the uncut wood without cutting it.",
    "CHAPTER 59 _Se_ , my “gather spirit,” is variously translated “frugality,” “moderation,” “restraint,” “being sparing,” or, by Waley, “laying up a store.",
    "” Evidently the core idea is that of saving.",
    "The chapter is usually presented in the manual-for-princes mode.",
    "Waley makes sense out of it by complex technical references; other versions make only gleams of sense.",
    "To persuade or coerce it into the personal mode meant a more radical interpretation than I usually dare attempt, but Waley’s reading, which points to the symbology of the breath ( _ch’i_ ) and the “long look” of the meditator, gave me the courage to try.",
    "Here is a version closer to the conventional ones:  In controlling people and serving heaven  it’s best to go easy.",
    "Going easy from the start is to gather power from the start, and gathered power keeps you safe.",
    "Safe, you can do what you like.",
    "Do what you like, the country’s yours.",
    "If you can make the country’s Mother yours, you’ll last a long time.",
    "You’ll have deep roots and a strong trunk.",
    "The way to live long is to look long.",
    "CHAPTER 61 The first seven lines continue the themes of “sameness” or assimilation, and of “being woman,” “being water,” the uses of yin.",
    "From there on, the language goes flat, and may be interpolated commentary.",
    "There’s an even feebler fourth verse: A big country needs more people, A small one needs more room.",
    "Each can get what it needs, but the big one needs to lie low.",
    "Because the _Ma wang tui_ texts are older, one longs to see them as more authentic, less corrupt.",
    "But though they are invaluable in offering variant readings, some of the variants may themselves be corruptions.",
    "In this chapter, the _Ma wang tui_ reads “Small countries, submitting to a great one, are dominated,” and in the next verse, “Some by lying low stay on top, but some by lying low stay on the bottom.",
    "” Both versions are truisms, but the _Ma wang tui_ version isn’t even a Taoistic truism.",
    "CHAPTER 62 The first and last verses hang together; the two middle verses are difficult and rather incoherent.",
    "Waley says the enigmatic second verse refers to sophists and sages who went about selling their “fine words” to the highest bidder, like our pop gurus and TV pundits.",
    "CHAPTER 64 I think the advice about being careful at the end of an undertaking was added, perhaps to balance the advice that the right time to act is before the beginning.",
    "It confuses the argument a bit, and I put it in parentheses.",
    "The line I give as “turn back to what people overlooked” is rendered by Lafargue as “turns back to the place all others have gone on from”; FengEnglish, “brings men back to what they have lost”; Henricks, “returns to what the masses have passed by”; Waley, “turning all men back to the things they have left behind.",
    "” Each version brings out a different color in the line, like different lights on an opal.",
    "CHAPTER 65 A dictator and his censors might all too easily cite from this chapter.",
    "A democrat might agree that the more people know, the harder they are for a ruler to govern—since the more they know, the better they are at governing themselves.",
    "Anyone might agree that an intellectual agenda pursued without reality-checking is indeed a curse upon the land.",
    "From the divine right of kings through the deadly teachings of Hitler and Mao to the mumbojumbo of economists, government by theory has done endless ill.",
    "But why is Lao Tzu’s alternative to it a people kept in ignorance.",
    "What kind of ignorance.",
    "Ignorance of what.",
    "Lao Tzu may be signalling us to ask such questions when he speaks of “understanding these things.",
    "” CHAPTER 69 Waley is my guide to the interpretation of the second verse, but I make very free with the last two lines of it.",
    "If they aren’t a rather vapid statement that one should never underestimate one’s foe, they must follow from what went before and lead to the extraordinary last verse.",
    "It all comes down to the last line and the word _shwai_.",
    "Carus translates it as “the weaker [the more compassionate],” and Bynner uses the word “compassion.",
    "” Waley translates it as “he who does not delight in war,” Henricks as “the one who feels grief,” Gibbs-Cheng as “the one stung by grief,” Feng-English as “the underdog,” Lafargue as “the one in mourning.",
    "” A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.",
    "CHAPTER 71 I follow Henricks in choosing the _Ma wang tui_ text, which has a double negative in the second line.",
    "Most other texts have “not knowing knowing is sickness.",
    "” CHAPTER 72 I take the liberty of reading this chapter as a description of what we, we ordinary people, should fear.",
    "The usual reading is in the manual-for-princes mode.",
    "In that case “what should be feared” is the ruler, the rightful authority, and the advice that follows is evidently directed to that ruler.",
    "It’s certainly what William Blake would have told the oligarchs of the Industrial Revolution, who still control our lives:  When people don’t fear what should be feared they are in fearful danger.",
    "Don’t make them live in narrow houses, don’t force them to do stupid work.",
    "When they’re not made stupid they won’t act stupidly.",
    "CHAPTER 74 I follow the _Ma wang tui_ text, but make very free with the word Henricks renders as “constant [in their behavior].",
    "” If I understand Henricks’ version, it says that if people were consistent in behaving normally and in fearing death, and if death were the penalty for abnormal behavior, nobody would dare behave abnormally; and so there would be no executions and no executioners.",
    "But this is not the case; as Lao Tzu says, there are times when even normal people lose their normal fear of death.",
    "So what is the poem about.",
    "I read it as saying that since we are inconsistent both in our behavior and in our fear of death, no person can rightfully take on the role of executioner, and should leave the death penalty to the judgment of heaven or nature.",
    "CHAPTER 80 To dismiss this Utopia as simply regressivist or anti-technological is to miss an interesting point.",
    "These people have labor-saving machinery, ships and land vehicles, weapons of offense and defense.",
    "They “have them and don’t use them.",
    "” I interpret: they aren’t used by them.",
    "We’re used, our lives shaped and controlled, by our machines, cars, planes, weaponry, bulldozers, computers.",
    "These Taoists don’t surrender their power to their creations.",
    "The eleventh line, however, is certainly regressive if it says knotted cords are to replace written literature, history, mathematics, and so on.",
    "It might be read as saying it’s best not to externalize all our thinking and remembering (as we do in writing and reading), but to keep it embodied, to think and remember with our bodies as well as our verbalizing brains.",
    "CHAPTER 81 This last poem is self-reflexive, wrapping it all up tight in the first verse, then opening out again to praise the undestructive, uncompetitive generosity of the spirit that walks on the Way.",
    "To my mind, the best reason for following the _Ma wang tui_ text in reversing the order of the books is that the whole thing ends with a chapter (37) that provides a nobler conclusion than this one.",
    "But if you reverse the order, chapter 1 turns up in the middle of the book, and I simply cannot believe that that’s right.",
    "That poem is a beginning.",
    "It is the beginning.",

    "The manuscript has been determined to be a school boy’s hand copy, complete with errors, and it reproduces not only the text (which appears in large characters), but also an early commentary (small, double-column characters).",
    "(The quality of schoolboy “handwriting” – actually brush and ink work – should probably make us all feel inadequate.",
    ")  Thousands of scholarly commentaries in Chinese have been written in the 2500 years of the _Analects_ ’ existence.",
    "Because so much important contextual information about the characters and special terms in the text does not appear within the _Analects_ , having originally been provided by teachers, we would find the text almost impossible to read with understanding were it not that early commentators preserved much of this information in their interlinear notes.",
    "Recovery of this particular copy of the text was unusually valuable, because the second century CE commentary it includes is a famous one by a great early scholar that has otherwise been largely lost.",
    "Unfortunately, the recovered text was only of a portion of the _Analects_ , so we do not now possess the entire commentary, but we are fortunate to have found even a part.",

    "i #### Introduction _The Analects of Confucius_ is an anthology of brief passages that present the words of Confucius and his disciples, describe Confucius as a man, and recount some of the events of his life.",
    "The book may have begun as a collection by Confucius’s immediate disciples soon after their Master’s death in 479 BCE.",
    "In traditional China, it was believed that its contents were quickly assembled at that time, and that it was an accurate record; the English title, which means “brief sayings of Confucius,” reflects this idea of the text.",
    "(The Chinese title, _Lunyu_ 論語, means “collated conversations.",
    "”) Modern scholars generally see the text as having been brought together over the course of two to three centuries, and believe little if any of it can be viewed as a reliable record of Confucius’s own words, or even of his individual views.",
    "Rather, much like the biblical Gospels, to which the text bears some resemblance, the _Analects_ offers an evolving record of the image of Confucius and his ideas through from the changing standpoints of various branches of the school of thought he founded.",
    "This online translation is posted to make it easier to locate an English rendering of this important text with some basic commentary.",
    "It has been prepared for use in undergraduate teaching and is not meant to replace published scholarly editions.",
    "The interpretations reflected are my own, and in some cases do not represent consensus readings (if such exist – there are, and always have been, competing interpretations of many of the most engaging passages in the text, starting from passage 1.",
    "1).",
    "In this very brief introduction to the text, I will summarize a few features of Confucius’s life and social environment, review some basic ways in which the component parts of the _Analects_ are dated by analysts, on a very general level, and note some particular issues concerning key terms and translation, and of personal names.",
    "**Confucius** “Confucius” is the name by which English speakers know Kong Qiu 孔丘, born near a small ducal state on the Shandong Peninsula in 551 BCE.",
    "Centuries earlier, a strong royal state, known as the Zhou (founded in 1045 BCE ), had sent members of its high aristocracy to rule regions of its empire as hereditary lords, subjects of the Zhou king, but, so long  ii as they remained loyal, masters of their local domains.",
    "In 771 BCE , raids by non-Zhou nomadic peoples led to the death of the Zhou king and the removal of the Zhou capital; from that time on, the Zhou kings had become weak, and the feudal lords had become de facto sovereigns over essentially independent states and statelets.",
    "Three themes of Confucius’s day were incessant warfare, which had been pervasive among the feudal lords since the devolution of power into their hands, the further devolution of power from the Zhou-appointed feudal houses into the hands of subordinate families that managed to accumulate power locally, and the rising fluidity of social mobility which this type of open competition for power encouraged, as intelligence and warrior skills in their assistants proved more valuable to competing power-holders than did hereditary pedigree.",
    "Confucius’s father was a member of the low aristocracy of the medium sized state of Lu 魯.",
    "According to our best sources, he was an important aide to a major aristocratic, or “grandee” family.",
    "During his prime, this family had served the greatest power holders in Lu by controlling a domain assigned to them on Lu’s southern border, near a small, non-Zhou cultural area called Zou 鄹.",
    "Shortly before Confucius’s birth, the family’s domain was relocated to the north, but Confucius’s father, having by his primary wife and his concubines produced no healthy sons to carry on his line, and being now an older man, chose at this time to take as a concubine a woman of Zou.",
    "She soon gave birth to Confucius.",
    "Three years later, Confucius’s father died, and Confucius apparently grew up with his mother’s family in the border region between Lu and Zou.",
    "Reaching adulthood, he traveled to the feudal center of Lu to seek social position, based on his father’s standing and connections.",
    "The state of Lu took pride in the fact that the lineage of its rightful lords, the dukes of Lu, had begun with a famous brother of the Zhou dynastic founder, a man known as the Duke of Zhou.",
    "Treasuring Zhou traditions with which he was associated, after the decline of the Zhou royal house the state of Lu had become known as the purest repository of Zhou aristocratic culture.",
    "But during the sixth century, these traditions were undermined, as powerful warlord families gained increasing control of government and resources in Lu, gradually marginalizing the legitimate ducal house, and distorting the norms of government form and ceremonial ritual that had made Lu distinct.",
    "iii  When Confucius sought his fortune in Lu, he probably appeared there as a semioutsider, the son of a “mixed” union between a man of Lu, who had long resided in Zou, and a woman of that non-Zhou place (see passage 3.",
    "15).",
    "But Confucius made his reputation as a strong advocate of a puristic revival of Zhou traditions in court conduct, religious ceremony, and every aspect of ordinary life.",
    "He became expert in these traditions, and it was on the basis of this knowledge and the persuasiveness of his claim that the way to bring order back to “the world” was to recreate early Zhou society through its ritual forms, or “ _li_ ,” that Confucius became known.",
    "The details of what Confucius saw as legitimate Zhou culture and why he thought its patterns were tools for building a new utopia are the principal subjects of the _Analects_.",
    "His mastery of Zhou cultural forms allowed Confucius to become a teacher of young aristocrats seeking polish, and through their connections, he was able to gain some stature in Lu.",
    "Ultimately, he and some of his followers attempted to implement a grand restorationist plan in Lu that would have shifted power back to the ducal house.",
    "Shortly after 500 BCE , when Confucius was about fifty, the plan failed, and Confucius was forced to leave his home state.",
    "For about fifteen years, he traveled with a retinue of disciples from state to state in eastern China, looking for a ruler who would employ him and adopt the policies he advocated.",
    "The _Analects_ pictures some key moments in these travels, which ultimately proved fruitless.",
    "A few years before his death, one of Confucius’s senior disciples, a man named Ran Qiu, arranged to have Confucius welcomed back to Lu, where he lived out his days as a teacher of young men, training them in the literary, ritual, and musical arts that he saw as central to the culture of the Zhou.",
    "**The Structure and Date of the** **_Analects_** During the Classical era, texts were generally recorded by brush and ink, writing on thin strips of bamboo.",
    "These strips allowed for about two dozen Chinese characters each.",
    "Holes were drilled in each strip and the strips that belonged to a single written work were bound together in a bundle by a string.",
    "The _Analects_ , which is composed of about five hundred independent passages, is divided into twenty “books.",
    "” Some of these books seem to have originated as strips authored, over a period of years, by a single group, and separated into bundles according to dominant themes.",
    "Others of the books seem to have origi iv nated independently, and been brought together with the larger number of books at a later date.",
    "Within each book, the order of passages appears to have been disrupted over time, to greater or lesser degree, either by disarrangements that occurred after the string of a bundle broke, or because part of the composition process involved conscious rearrangement and insertion of later passages into existing bundles / books, in order to adjust the way the message of the overall text was conveyed.",
    "Through this process, the Analects has come to appear quite random on first reading, and no depth of analysis has yet removed that sense of randomness from large portions of the text.",
    "While this is not ideal for readers who wish to understand the message of the _Analects_ , it has been very good news for academic textual analysts, for whom the long process of trying to untangle the text and understand how it came to be shaped as it is has provided gainful employment and opportunities for tenure.",
    "*^ Although there is consensus about a few points, such as the fact that several of the books, such as Books XVI and XX, are very late additions, there is more disagreement than agreement about specific issues of dating and origin of the _Analects_ ’ various components.",
    "The translation that follows here operates on the following model.",
    "Books III through VII are seen as a core text from a single, relatively early origin, with the books, in their original form (now much altered) sorted by topic in roughly this way:  Book III – General issues of ritual ( li ) Book IV – General issues of character Book V – Comments about disciples and historical figures Book VI – Comments about disciples and historical figures Book VII – Descriptions of Confucius Among all the books, the most consistent in structure and apparently least altered in form is Book IV.",
    "Examination of that book does seem to yield some pretty clear principles about what the original editorial goals were, and what regular processes of alteration later occurred.",
    "* (^) The most detailed attempt in English to reconstruct this process of textual accretion is Bruce and Taeko Brooks, _The Original Analects_ (NY: Columbia, 1999).",
    "The dating model used here does not approach that of the Brooks’ in detail, and is based on different premises.",
    "v  Traditionally, it has been widely noted that Books I-X seem to bear some similar features of length, structure, and vocabulary, and it has become common to speak of those books as the “upper text” and Books XI-XX as the “lower text.",
    "” Rounding out the “upper text”:  Book I – Designed as an overview introduction for disciple-readers Book II – General issues of governance Book VIII – Miscellaneous, embedding a “core” of quotes from a disciple, Master Zeng, a diverse set of passages with some indications of common origins with Book XVII, and an outer text “shell” of historical commentary* Book IX – Perhaps a variant version of Book VII, from a different school branch Book X – A portrait of ritualized perfection, cast as a description of Confucius In some of these cases (II and IX), the core theme seems to be present in a relatively small number of passages, and the books seem particularly heterogeneous.",
    "The “lower text” is even less coherent.",
    "There seems to be some resemblance of structure and tone among Books XI-XV; in some cases, a thematic aspect seems visible, in others not.",
    "Book XI – Comments on disciples Book XII – General issues of governance Book XIII – General issues of governance Book XIV – Includes themes of reclusion Book XV – A broad collection It is reasonable to suggest that at their core, these five chapters originated as sorted collections made by a single branch of the school, different from the branch that may have collected Books III-VII, with the collection deriving from a somewhat later date.",
    "The remaining five books have been regarded for several centuries as later and less authoritative than the others.",
    "For some of these, the later date seems certain:  Book XVI – Written in a very different style and dominated by numbered lists Book XVII – Many passages “re-imagining” political issues of Confucius’s time Book XVIII – Focusing on reclusion and responsive to “Daoist” ideas Book XX – A small appendix of miscellaneous items * (^) Appendix 3 includes a detailed analysis of the structure of Book VIII.",
    "vi One book among the final five appears different from the rest:  Book XIX – Recording the sayings of disciples after Confucius’s death This book may well be much earlier than the others in the “lower text” – it was likely at one time the final book, and the bulk of it may actually have been composed in association with Books III-VII, viewed as the oldest portion of the book.",
    "All of the books bear the traces of rearrangements and later insertions, to a degree that makes it difficult to see any common thematic threads at all.",
    "If a full account of these alterations in the text could be made, it would likely provide a clear and valuable reflection of the way that the Confucian school and its various branches developed over the first two or three centuries of the school’s existence.",
    "Recent finds of early manuscripts dating from c.",
    "300 BCE have thrown additional light on these processes of text development.",
    "For a fuller discussion, see Appendix 3.",
    "**Key Terms and Translation Issues** The philosophy conveyed through the _Analects_ is basically an ethical perspective, and the text has always been understood as structured on a group of key ethical terms.",
    "These (along with some terms key to other early streams of Chinese thought) are discussed in more detail in the Glossary (Appendix 2).",
    "Notes in the text also touch on all these issues, but a brief overview here may be useful.",
    "There is a group of key terms whose meaning seems to be so flexible, subtle, and disputed that it seems best to leave them untranslated, simply using transcription for them.",
    "These include:  Ren 仁 – a comprehensive ethical virtue: benevolence, humaneness, goodness; the term is so problematic that many Analects passages show disciples trying to pin Confucius down on its meaning (he escapes being pinned).",
    "Junzi 君子 – often used to denote an ideally ethical and capable person; sometimes simply meaning a power holder, which is its original sense.",
    "Dao 道 – a teaching or skill formula that is a key to some arena of action: an art, self-perfection, world transformation.",
    "Li 禮 – the ritual institutions of the Zhou, of which Confucius was master; the range of behavior subject to the broad category denoted by this term ranges from political protocol to court ceremony, religious rite to village festival, daily etiquette to disciplines of personal conduct when alone.",
    "vii  Tian – carrying the basic meaning of “sky,” Tian becomes a concept of supreme deity, often translated as “Heaven,” sometimes possessing clear anthropomorphic features, sometimes appearing more a natural force.",
    "In addition to these items, other complex key terms are rendered by very vague English words, the meaning of which can only emerge as contextual usage is noted.",
    "Virtue ( de 德) – a very complex concept, initially related to the notion of charisma derived from power and gift-giving, developing into an ethical term denoting self-possession and orientation towards moral action.",
    "Pattern ( wen 文) – denoting a relation to features of civilization that are distinctive to Zhou culture, or to traditions ancestral to the Zhou; wen can refer to decoration, written texts, and personal conduct, but most importantly, it points to the behavioral matrix underlying Zhou li.",
    "Finally, a set of important terms can be translated with some accuracy into English, but only with the understanding that the conceptual range of the Chinese term may not match English perfectly; in some cases, alternate English translations are used.",
    "Right / Righteousness ( yi 義) – often a complement to ren , denoting morally correct action choices, or the moral vision that allows one to make them.",
    "Loyalty ( zhong 忠) – denoting not only loyalty to one’s superiors or peers, or to individuals, but also to office; an alignment of self with the interests of others, or of the social group as a whole.",
    "Trustworthiness / Faithfulness ( xin 信) – derived from the concept of promise keeping, meaning reliability for others, but also unwavering devotion to principle.",
    "Respectfulness / Attentiveness ( jing 敬) – derived from the notion of alertness, and fusing the attentiveness to task characteristic of a subordinate and the respect for superiors that such attentiveness reflects.",
    "Filiality ( xiao 孝) – a traditional cultural imperative, obedience to parents, raised to a subtle level of fundamental self-discipline and character building.",
    "Valor ( yong 勇) – in a feudal era marked by incessant warfare, bold warriors and adventurers were common; for Confucians, valor concerns risk taking on behalf of ethical principle.",
    "**Personal Names** Although this is not clear on initial reading, the ideas of the _Analects_ are importantly influenced by the literary character of the text, and the fact that it is presented chiefly as conversational interplay among a relatively limited cast of characters: Confucius (“the Master”), his disciples, and a group of power holders with whom Confucius interacts.",
    "The _Analects_ was almost certainly used as a teaching text for later generations of disci viii ples, who were taught not only the text but much detail about the contexts and characters now lost to us, and it is certain that the original audience of the text developed a grasp of the rich nuances conveyed by the way statements in the text are distributed among its various speakers.",
    "Most importantly, the disciples in the _Analects_ provided a range of positive and negative models readers could emulate as they attempted to find their way into Confucian teachings, and develop into the true inheritors of the _tao_ of discipleship.",
    "Unfortunately for readers of the text in translation, the characters in the Analects are each referred to by a variety of names, reflecting the customs of the times.",
    "It was the general rule that members of the aristocracy, at any level, possessed at least three types of names.",
    "They could possess many more.",
    "The three basic names are: 1.",
    "Surname (family name – family names precede other names in Chinese) 2.",
    "Personal name (given at birth, used by intimates – like our first names) 3.",
    "Style, or polite name (given at puberty, used publicly and in formal settings) When it comes to the disciples, the narrative voice of the text usually refers to them by their polite style name, but Confucius is generally pictured calling them by their personal names (as a teacher, he was a surrogate parent).",
    "For example, in passage 11.",
    "15 (Book XI, passage 15) we read:  The Master said, “What is Yóu’s zither doing at my gate.",
    "” The disciples showed Zilu no respect.",
    "Yóu and Zilu are the same person.",
    "He is the disciple Zhong Yóu (surname: Zhong, personal name: Yóu).",
    "Confucius calls him by his personal name, but the narrative voice, being a later disciple writing about a revered elder of the past, uses the polite Zilu.",
    "(Zilu is, in addition, referred to by what appears to be a “generational name”; Ji Yóu, the “Ji” indicating that in his family, he was the fourth eldest male of his generation.",
    ")  Finally, some disciples whose later followers likely had a clear impact on the text are referred to as “masters” in their own right; the most prominent example is “Master Zeng,” who is Zeng Shen, among the youngest of the major disciples.",
    "In the case of Zeng Shen, the influence of his own branch of the Confucian school is particularly visible; a portion of Book VIII is devoted to descriptions of his dying words, words likely uttered over forty years after the death of Confucius.",
    "The reference to any disciple as “Master” indicates that they had some later influence, but does not indicate that they were, in Con ix fucius’s day, influential among Confucius’s own disciples.",
    "Indeed, a number of the greatest disciples died before Confucius, and thus could never have earned the title of “Master” in their own right.",
    "In the notes to the text, I have tried to provide information and reminders necessary to keep track of the various disciples, so that it is possible for their characters and the individual ways their roles shape subtle meaning to emerge.",
    "But this is hard to grasp on initial reading, no matter how much help is provided.",
    "For the sake of directness, I will close this Introduction with a list of some of the major disciples, and, where it may be known, the dates that have been reconstructed for them.",
    "This list by no means exhausts the roster of disciples who appear in the _Analects_ , or even the roster of interesting ones, but these are the ones who appear most frequently.",
    "Their names are given as surname + personal name, with style and variant names in parentheses.",
    "Fuller descriptions of the major disciples appear in Appendix 1.",

    "8 A famous passage, puzzling because the Confucian stress on the dao as an instrument for political action runs counter to the passive tone of the beautiful rhetoric here.",
    "4.",
    "9 ‘Gentleman’ translates shi 士, a term applied to all well-born men, from rulers to lower aristocrats.",
    "It came to point more towards the lower levels, and then as a normative term, came to signify a person of basic moral attainments and culture, worthy of being treated as an aristocrat, regardless of birth.",

    "4), a very junior disciple, possessed the sort of esoteric understanding this passage suggests.",
    "Moreover, reference to this young follower as “Zengzi,” that is, “Master Zeng,” increases the probability that Zeng Shen’s role in the text has been crafted by his own disciples after his death in 436 BCE (see especially 8.",

    "One of the interesting puzzles of the early Confucian movement was its great emphasis on li , which included religious rituals, in which Confucians were professional specialists, and the frequent expressions of skepticism about the efficacy of those rituals to effect outcomes.",

    "Emperor Shun passed his kingdom to Yu, rather than to his son, and so did not treat the throne as belonging to his own lineage.",
    "This was not the case with Yu, however, and in the book Mencius , where this aphorism appears, Yu is not included.",

    "19 Emperor Yao, in Confucian tradition the first of the sage rulers, world yet treated none of it as their own.",

    "Towering is the grandeur of Tian; only Yao could emulate it.",
    "So boundless the people could find no name for them – towering were his achievements.",

    "20 Shun possessed five ministers and the world was ordered.",
    "King Wu said, “I have ten ministers to curtail the chaos.",

    "In the times of Yao and Shun it was most abundant.",
    "And of the ten, one was a woman: it was merely nine.",
    "“The Zhou controlled two-thirds of the empire, yet continued to serve the Yin.",
    "The virtue of the Zhou may be said to be the utmost of virtue.",

    "21 The Master said, I can find no fault in Yu.",

    "8.",
    "20 The first part of Confucius’s comment refers to a belief that King Wu’s wife served a key role in governance.",
    "The second part refers to the pre-conquest reign of King Wen, who forbore to conquer the Shang (Yin) Dynasty, although most of the empire had been swayed by his virtue to regard him as the true king.",
    "8.",
    "21 Yu was celebrated as the ideal ruler by the Mohists, early adversaries of the Ruist, or Confucian school.",
    "His story was part myth – Yu was at some point a flood myth hero, and famous for singlehandedly dredging the rivers of China and draining a worldthreatening flood.",
    "The Mohists, who believed virtue lay simply in selfless effort for others and who regarded ritual (and Confucians) as wasteful extravagance, promoted Yu as an exemplar of thrift, simplicity, and self-sacrifice.",
    "In this passage, Confucius seems to ‘adopt’ Yu by picturing him as equally devoted to thrifty selfsacrifice and ritual perfection.",

    "18 Zhai was simpleminded; Shen was slow; Shi was puffed up; Yóu was coarse.",

    "13 Both because of his bold temperament and his political engagement with the warlord Ji clan, Zilu’s relationship with Confucius was fraught with tensions.",
    "Disciple-readers of the Analects would recognize irony here: historical accounts report that Zilu (Yóu) was, in fact, killed during a coup d’état in the state of Wei, displaying brave loyalty to a ruler he knew had already been murdered.",

    "Zeng Xi refers to “capped” young men, meaning youths who have reached the age of the “capping ceremony,” a ritual among the Zhou elite that accompanied a young man’s entry into public life.",
    "The specific li of the spring lustration (ritual bathing) is not a ritual recorded in other early texts, but a custom of late spring excursion in the manner of this passage is well attested in later centuries, perhaps inspired by the much admired poetic imagery of Zeng Xi’s speech.",

    "Book XII is highly formulaic in its rhetoric, and is likely a later book, articulating more polished expressions of concepts that had become key to the early Confucian school.",
    "A recently recovered bamboo manuscript, dating from c.",
    "300 BCE , includes a variant of 12.",

    "By comparing it with the version in the received text translated here we can get some sense of the choices that may have been available to the editors of today’s Analects.",
    "See Appendix 4, page 134.",
    "12.",
    "2 The force of this passage lies principally in the concreteness of the first two parts of Confucius’s response, followed by the generalized statement, close to the Golden Rule.",
    "We do not normally think of the Golden Rule in terms of the highly ritualized conduct described here.",
    "This linkage is what ties 12.",
    "1 and 12.",
    "2 together.",

    "3 Sima Niu is identified as a disciple whose brother, Huan Tui, was Minister of War in the state of Song.",
    "In 7.",
    "23, we see Huan Tui as a threatening enemy.",
    "12.",
    "4 Sima Niu asked about the _junzi_.",
    "The Master said, “The _junzi_ is not beset with care or fear.",
    "” “Not beset with care or fear – may such a person, then, be called a _junzi_.",
    "” “Surveying himself within and finding no fault, what care or fear could there be.",
    "” 12.",
    "5 Sima Niu was beset with care.",
    "“All people have brothers, I alone am without one.",
    "” Zixia said, “I have heard it said, ‘Life and death are preordained, wealth and rank are up to Tian.",
    "The _junzi_ never lets slip his respectful vigilance: when with others, he is reverent and acts with _li_ – in the world within the four seas, all men are his brothers.",
    "’ What concern need a _junzi_ have that he is without brothers.",
    "” 12.",
    "6 Zizhang asked about discernment.",
    "The Master said, “When one is uninfluenced by slanderous statements about someone that reach a saturation point or by disputes that are brought before him that have a direct bearing on him, then he may be said to be discerning.",
    "He may also be said to be farsighted.",
    "” 12.",
    "7 Zigong asked about governance.",
    "The Master said, “Provide people with adequate food, provide them with adequate weapons, induce them to have faith in their ruler.",
    "” Zigong said, “If you had no choice but to dispense with one of those three things, which would it be.",
    "” “Dispense with weapons.",
    "” “If you had no choice but to dispense  12.",

    "2, 12.",
    "3 and 12.",
    "4 are perfectly parallel in construction, reflecting well crafted teachings of a maturing school.",
    "12.",
    "5 Sima Niu did have a brother: Confucius’s enemy Huan Tui.",
    "We must presume he means here a brother who acts like a brother.",
    "Zixia’s response is the source of the famous phrase, “all men are brothers,” which has been much associated with Chinese culture in the West.",
    "12.",
    "6 ‘Discernment’ translates a word ( ming 明) that could also be rendered ‘enlightenment’.",
    "Either way, the term here is related to the idea of objectivity.",
    "with one of those two things, which would it be.",

    "From ancient times there has always been death.",
    "If the people do not have faith, the state cannot stand.",

    "8 Ji Zicheng said, “Being a _junzi_ is simply a matter of one’s plain substance.",
    "Of what use are patterns ( _wen_ ).",
    "” Zigong said, “What a shame that you have described the _junzi_ in this way – a team of horses is not as swift as the tongue.",
    "If patterns were like plain substance and plain substance like patterns, the pelts of tigers and leopards would be like those of hounds and sheep.",

    "9 Duke Ai questioned You Ruo.",
    "“In years of famine, when I do not take in enough to meet my expenditures, what should I do.",
    "” You Ruo replied, “Why not set taxes at the rate of one-tenth.",
    "” “At the rate of two-tenths my income is not adequate – how could I manage at onetenth.",
    "” You Ruo replied, “When the people have sufficient means, who will not provide the ruler with what he needs; when the people do not have sufficient means, who will provide the ruler with what he needs.",
    "” 12.",
    "10 Zizhang asked about exalting virtue and discerning confusion.",
    "The Master said, “Taking loyalty and trustworthiness as the pivot and ever shifting to align with the right: that is exalting virtue.",
    "When one cherishes a person one wishes him to live; when one hates a person one wishes him to die –  12.",
    "8 Ji Zicheng was a grandee in the state of Wei.",
    "Presumably he interviewed Confucius during the latter’s sojourn in Wei.",
    "The metaphor conveys the idea that one must be wary of speaking carelessly, as words once uttered can’t be called back.",
    "Compare 6.",

    "9 You Ruo is the disciple Master You (see 1.",
    "2), who is said to have for a short time succeeded Confucius as leader and teacher of the original group of disciples.",
    "(See Appendix 1.",
    ")  12.",
    "10 This passage has considerable overlap with 12.",
    "21, which is helpful as a gloss on the last section of this passage.",

    "_Truly, it is not a matter of riches, Indeed, it is simply about discernment.",

    "11 Duke Jing of Qi asked Confucius about governance.",
    "Confucius replied, “Let the ruler be ruler, ministers ministers, fathers fathers, sons sons.",
    "” The Duke said, “Excellent.",
    "Truly, if the ruler is not ruler, ministers not ministers, fathers not fathers, sons not sons, though I possess grain, will I be able to eat it.",
    "” 12.",
    "12 The Master said, “Able to adjudicate a lawsuit by hearing a single statement – would this not characterize Yóu.",
    "” Zilu never postponed fulfillment of a promise overnight.",
    "12.",
    "13 The Master said, In hearing lawsuits, I am no better than others.",
    "What is imperative is to make it so that there are no lawsuits.",
    "12.",
    "14 Zizhang asked about governance.",
    "The Master said, “Fulfill your office untiringly, perform your duties with loyalty.",
    "” 12.",
    "15 The Master said, Once a _junzi_ has studied broadly in patterns and constrained them with _li_ , indeed he will never turn his back on them.",
    "12.",
    "16 The Master said, The _junzi_ perfects what is beautiful in people, he does not perfect what is ugly.",
    "The small man does just the opposite.",
    "12.",
    "11 Confucius was said to have visited Qi several times.",
    "Duke Jing died before Confucius’s exile from Lu, and so this interview is set during Confucius’s relative youth.",
    "This passage is often interpreted in light of 13.",
    "3.",
    "12.",
    "12 An alternative translation, less charitable to Zilu, interprets the first sentence to be apparent sarcasm: “Able to adjudicate after hearing only one side.",
    "”  12.",
    "13 This passage is cited in The Great Learning , a text likely from the late Warring States or Qin periods, which notes that lawsuits permit those whose claims have no substance to use words to obscure what is so.",

    "17 Ji Kangzi questioned Confucius about governance.",
    "Confucius replied, “Governance is setting things upright.",
    "If you lead with uprightness, who will dare not to be upright.",
    "” 12.",
    "18 Ji Kangzi was concerned about bandits, and asked advice of Confucius.",
    "Confucius replied, “If you yourself were truly not covetous, though you rewarded people for it, they would not steal.",
    "” 12.",
    "19 Ji Kangzi asked Confucius about governance, saying, “How would it be if I were to kill those who are without the _dao_ in order to hasten others towards the _dao_.",
    "” Confucius replied, “Of what use is killing in your governance.",
    "If you desire goodness, the people will be good.",
    "The virtue of the _junzi_ is like the wind and the virtue of common people is like the grasses: when the wind blows over the grasses, they will surely bend.",

    "20 Zizhang asked, “When may a gentleman be said to have attained success.",
    "” The Master said, “What do you mean by attaining success.",
    "” Zizhang replied, “His name is renowned throughout his state and his household.",
    "” The Master said, “This is to be renowned, not to be successful.",
    "Attaining success lies in being straightforward in basic substance and loving the right, being perspicacious when listening to others speak and observant of their facial expressions, and bearing in mind deference towards others.",
    "Such a person will surely attain success in  12.",
    "17 This passage embeds a significant pun.",
    "The words for ‘governance’ ( zheng 政) and ‘upright’ ( zheng 正) are homonyms that overlap in both graph forms and corresponding meaning.",
    "12.",
    "18 This passage and the next express the Confucian faith in the great force of example presented by those in positions of power.",
    "12.",
    "19 The last phrase of this passage is very famous.",
    "It is unclear, perhaps by design, whether ‘ junzi ’ in this instance refers to ethical exemplars or simply men in power.",
    "12.",
    "20 The phrase ‘attained success’ here translates the same term rendered as ‘get through’ at 14.",
    "23 and 14.",
    "35.",
    "The basic sense of the term is to achieve recognition from those in authority, and so gain a visible social role.",
    "In describing the man of renown, the notion of ‘household’ clearly goes beyond family.",
    "In Confucius’s era, men of renown were nobles with the wealth to maintain large establishments that included many well born retainers in service.",
    "the state and in his household.",
    "“As for being renowned, such a man gets a reputation for _ren_ from appearances, though his conduct contravenes it, and he is free of self-doubt.",
    "His name is reknowned throughout his state and his household.",
    "” 12.",
    "21 Fan Chi accompanied the Master on an outing past the altar of the great rain dance.",
    "“May I ask about exalting virtue, reforming faults, and discerning confusion.",
    "” The Master said, “Well asked.",
    "Be first to the effort and last to take reward – is that not exalting virtue.",
    "To set to work upon one’s own faults and not upon the faults of others, is that not the way to reform faults.",
    "In the anger of the moment to forget one’s safety and that of one’s parents, is that not confusion.",
    "” 12.",
    "22 Fan Chi asked about _ren_.",
    "The Master said, “Cherish people.",
    "” When he asked about knowledge, the Master said, “Know people,” and Fan Chi did not understand.",
    "The Master said, “If you raise up the straight and place them over the crooked, they can make the crooked straight.",
    "” Fan Chi took his leave and went to see Zixia.",
    "“Just now, I was with the Master and asked him about knowledge.",
    "He said, ‘If you raise up the straight and place them over the crooked, they can make the crooked straight.",
    "’ What did he mean.",
    "” Zixia said, “How rich these words are.",
    "When Shun possessed the world he picked Gaoyao out from among the multitudes, and those who were not _ren_ kept far distant.",
    "When Tang possessed the world, he picked Yi Yin out from among the multitudes, and  12.",
    "21 This passage seems to give alternative approaches to queries posed in 12.",
    "10.",
    "12.",
    "22 In Zixia’s closing remark, he refers to figures from legendary and pre-Zhou history.",
    "Gaoyao was a sagely member of the court of the legendary Emperor Shun, variously reported to have been in charge of criminals and in charge of music.",
    "Tang was the founding king of the Shang Dynasty, and Yi Yin was his principal aide.",

    "23 Zigong asked about friends.",
    "The Master said, “Advise them loyally and guide them well.",
    "If this does not work, desist.",
    "Do not humiliate yourself.",
    "” 12.",
    "24 Master Zeng said, A _junzi_ attracts friends through his patterned behavior, and employs friends to assist him in _ren_.",

    "23 This resonates with 4.",

    "Book XIII 13.",
    "1 Zilu asked about governance.",
    "The Master said, “Be first to the task and comfort others at their labors.",
    "” When asked for more, he said, “Be tireless.",

    "2 Zhonggong was serving as steward for the Ji family.",
    "He asked about governance.",
    "The Master said, “Provide a leading example to your officers.",
    "Pardon minor offences.",
    "Raise up the worthy.",
    "” “How can I recognize who has worthy abilities so I can raise them up.",
    "” “Raise up those you recognize.",
    "As for those you don’t recognize, will the others let you do without them.",
    "” 13.",
    "3 Zilu said, “If the ruler of Wei were to entrust you with governance of his state, what would be your first priority.",
    "” The Master said, “Most certainly, it would be to rectify names.",
    "” Zilu said, “Is that so.",
    "How strange of you.",
    "How would this set things right.",
    "” The Master said, “What a boor you are, Yóu.",
    "A _junzi_ keeps silent about things he doesn’t understand.",
    "“If names are not right then speech does not accord with things; if speech is not in accord with things, then affairs cannot be successful; when affairs are not successful, _li_ and music do not flourish; when _li_ and music do not flourish, then sanctions and punishments miss their mark; when sanctions and punishments miss their mark, the people have no place to set their hands and feet.",
    "“Therefore, when a _junzi_ gives things  Notes  13.",
    "1 Many of the passages in Book XIII have to do with governance, as is true of the latter part of Book XII.",
    "13.",
    "3 This states one facet of what is known as the doctrine of the “rectification of names.",
    "” There are many aspects to this idea.",
    "Passage 12.",
    "11, which stresses the need for people to perform their social roles properly, is often taken as a basic text for this doctrine.",
    "Passages 3.",
    "1 and 3.",
    "2, which concern usurpations of ritual prerogatives, are also sometimes linked to these ideas.",
    "Those passages stress the need to make one’s conduct match one’s social position.",
    "13.",
    "3 stresses the need to align names to reflect the reality of circumstances; in this, it may resonate with 6.",
    "25.",

    "With regard to speech, the _junzi_ permits no carelessness.",

    "4 Fan Chi asked to learn about farming grain.",
    "The Master said, “Better to ask an old peasant.",
    "” He asked about raising vegetables.",
    "“Better to ask an old gardener.",
    "” When Fan Chi left, the Master said, “What a small man Fan Xu is.",
    "If a ruler loved _li_ , none among the people would dare be inattentive; if a ruler loved right, none would dare be unsubmissive; if a ruler loved trustworthiness, none would dare be insincere.",
    "The people of the four quarters would come to him with their children strapped on their backs.",
    "Why ask about farming.",
    "” 13.",
    "5 The Master said, If a man can recite from memory the three hundred odes of the _Poetry_ but, when you entrust him with governance, he is unable to express his meaning, or, when you send him to the four quarters on diplomatic missions, he is unable to make replies on his own initiative, though he may have learned much, of what use is he.",
    "13.",
    "6 The Master said, If he is upright in his person, he will perform without orders.",
    "If he is not upright in his person, though you give him orders, he will not carry them out.",
    "13.",
    "7 The Master said, The governments of the states of Lu and Wei are like older and younger brothers.",
    "13.",
    "8 The Master commented that Prince Jing of Wei handled possessing his residences  13.",
    "4 Confucius refers to the disciple Fan Chi by his personal name, Xu.",
    "13.",
    "5 The Poetry had become, by Confucius’s time, a canonical collection of songs well known to the patrician elite, who would at times communicate subtle messages by chanting lines from the songs in place of straightforward speech (as one sees throughout the Analects ).",
    "In this way, the authoritative text became a powerful tool to invoke ethical ideas associated with its lyrics.",
    "Memorizing the text was significant, but if one could not put the songs to use through creative citation in social action, mastery counted for nothing.",
    "It is for this reason that the Poetry was an important part of the Confucian ritual curriculum.",
    "13.",
    "7 As the former fief of the Duke of Zhou and a repository of Zhou culture, Lu’s government was admired, though no longer under the control of the rightful duke.",
    "The well.",
    "When he first possessed a home he said, “This is truly a good fit.",
    "” When he came to have some luxuries he said, “This is truly complete.",

    "9 The Master traveled to the state of Wei.",
    "Ran Yǒu drove his chariot.",
    "The Master said, “How populous it is.",
    "” Ran Yǒu said, “As Wei is already populous, what would you add.",
    "” “Enrich them.",
    "” “Once the people were enriched, what would you add.",
    "” “Teach them.",
    "” 13.",
    "10 The Master said, If there were someone who would employ me, things would be in hand within a year on the.",
    "In three years, they would have come to success.",
    "13.",
    "11 The Master said, “‘If good men governed for a hundred years, cruelty could indeed be overcome and killing dispensed with.",
    "’ How very true that saying is.",
    "” 13.",
    "12 The Master said, If there were one who reigned as a true king, after a generation, all would be _ren_.",
    "13.",
    "13 The Master said, If one can make his person upright, then what difficulty will he have in taking part in governance.",
    "If he cannot make his person upright, how can be make others upright.",

    "14 Ranzi came from court.",
    "The Master said, “Why are you late.",
    "” Ranzi replied, “There were matters of government.",
    "”  state of Wei was originally the fief of the Duke of Zhou’s younger brother, and here Confucius, who was hopeful of political opportunities in Wei, suggests that like Lu, Wei also possessed political virtues.",
    "13.",
    "10 This and the following two passages share a theme in common with 13.",
    "29.",
    "13.",
    "14 Ranzi is the disciple Ran Qiu (Yǒu).",
    "The court referred to is likely the Ji clan court, where Ran The Master said, “Surely, these were affairs of the household.",
    "Were there matters of government, though I am not in office, I would be advised of them.",
    "” 13.",
    "15 Duke Ding asked, “Is there a single saying that can lead a state to flourish.",
    "” Confucius replied, “No saying can have such an effect, but there is one that comes close: There is a saying, ‘It is hard to be a ruler; it is not easy being a minister.",
    "’ If one thus understood how hard it is to rule, would this not come close to a single saying leading a state to flourish.",
    "” “Is there a single saying that can destroy a state.",
    "” Confucius replied, “No saying can have such an effect, but there is one that comes close: There is a saying, ‘There is nothing I love more about being a ruler than that no one contradicts me.",
    "’ If a ruler were fine and none contradicted him, that would be fine indeed; if he were not a good ruler and none contradicted him, then would this not come close to a single saying destroying a state.",
    "” 13.",
    "16 The Lord of She asked about governance.",
    "The Master said, “Those nearby are pleased, those far distant come.",
    "” 13.",
    "17 Zixia served as steward of Jufu and asked about governance.",
    "The Master said, “Don’t seek quick results; don’t attend to matters of minor profit.",
    "If you seek quick results, you will not attain success; if you attend to matters of minor profit, you will not succeed in great affairs.",
    "”  Qiu served as steward.",
    "Confucius seems to be making a distinction between affairs of the Ji clan – which should rightly concern only matters of their hereditary domain, or household – and matters of state, which should rightly concern only the duke’s court.",
    "13.",
    "18 The Lord of She instructed Confucius, saying, “There is an upright man in my district.",
    "His father stole a sheep, and he testified against him.",
    "” Confucius said, “The upright men in my district are different.",
    "Fathers cover up for their sons and sons cover up for their fathers.",
    "Uprightness lies therein.",
    "” 13.",
    "19 Fan Chi asked about _ren_.",
    "The Master said, “Let your bearing be reverent when you are at leisure, be respectfully attentive in managing affairs, and be loyal towards others.",
    "Though you be among barbarians, these may never be cast aside.",
    "” 13.",
    "20 Zigong asked, “How must one be in order to deserve being called a gentleman.",
    "” The Master said, “One who conducts himself with a sense of shame and who may be dispatched to the four quarters without disgracing his lord’s commission, such a one may be termed a gentleman.",
    "” “May I ask what is next best.",
    "” “When his clan calls him filial and his neighborhood district calls him respectful of elders.",
    "” “May I ask what is next best.",
    "” “Keeping to one’s word and following through in one’s actions – it has the ring of a petty man, but indeed, this would be next.",
    "” “What are those who participate in governance today like.",
    "” “Oh.",
    "They are men you measure by bucket or scoop – why even count them.",
    "” 13.",
    "21 The Master said, Those who cannot keep to the central path in their conduct but who are still worth some praise are surely the  13.",
    "18 This famous passage reflects the Confucian stress on filiality as an essential foundation for virtue, and an inalienable component of good character.",
    "In other texts, the ‘upright man’ in the Lord of She’s example is praised, disputing the valuation of family over state that Confucius articulates here.",
    "13.",
    "21 ‘Things they are unwilling to do’ means there is a limit to the immoral acts they will take in order to please their lord.",
    "reckless and the timid.",
    "The reckless are willing to advance towards the goal, and the timid have things that they are unwilling to do.",
    "13.",
    "22 The Master said, “The people of the South have a saying: ‘A person without constancy may not be a shaman or a doctor.",
    "’ This is very fine.",
    "” “If one is not constant in virtue, one may receive disgrace” – the Master said, “Simply do not divine.",
    "” 13.",
    "23 The Master said, The _junzi_ acts in harmony with others but does not seek to be like them; the small man seeks to be like others and does not act in harmony.",
    "13.",
    "24 Zigong asked, “If all the people of your village loved you, how would that be.",
    "” The Master said, “Not good enough.",
    "” “If all the people of your village hated you, how would that be.",
    "” “The Master said, “Not good enough.",
    "Better that the good people in your village love you and the bad people hate you.",
    "” 13.",
    "25 The Master said, The _junzi_ is easy to serve and hard to please.",
    "If you do not accord with the _dao_ in pleasing him, he is not pleased; when it comes to employing others, he only puts them to tasks they are fit to manage.",
    "The small man is hard to serve but easy to please.",
    "If you do not accord with the _dao_ in pleasing him, he is still pleased; when it comes to employing others, he demands they be able in everything.",
    "13.",
    "22 It is difficult to parse this passage well.",
    "The second portion begins with a citation from the mantic text Yi jing (Book of Changes).",
    "Confucius’s final comment seems to pertain to it.",
    "However, an alternative reading lays stress on the word ‘constant’, shared by the ‘saying of the South’ and the Yi jing passage, and links those as a single unit.",
    "Because of the passage quotes the Yi jing , Confucius’s final comment is sometimes also taken to refer to the Yi , and to suggest that the text should not be used for fortunetelling, but rather simply to understand how action consequences vary with contexts.",
    "That is the interpretation governing this translation.",
    "13.",
    "26 The Master said, The _junzi is at ease_ without being arrogant; the small man is arrogant without being at ease.",
    "13.",
    "27 The Master said, Incorruptibility, steadfastness, simplicity, and reticence are near to _ren_.",
    "13.",
    "28 Zilu asked, “How must one be in order to deserve being called a gentleman.",
    "” The Master said, “Supportive, encouraging, congenial – such a man may be called a gentleman.",
    "Supportive and encouraging with his friends, congenial with his brothers.",
    "” 13.",
    "29 The Master said, If a good man were to instruct the people for seven years, they would indeed be ready to go into battle.",
    "13.",
    "30 The Master said, Not to teach the people how to fight in war may called discarding them.",
    "13.",
    "29 A recently discovered text of the “Huang-Lao” (Daoist/Legalist) tradition of the third to second century BCE pictures the ideal ruler as nurturing a state for seven years to prepare it for battle.",
    "This passage and the next may reflect the influence of non-Confucian thought in those later times.",

    "29 may be contrasted with what would seem the more purely Confucian position in 13.",

    "Book XIV 14.",

    "18-23 A particularly extended string of passages on a common theme: the junzi.",
    "15.",
    "19 The Master said, The _junzi_ blames himself for lacking ability; he does not blame others for not recognizing him.",
    "15.",
    "20 The Master said, The _junzi_ is apprehensive that he may leave the world without his name remaining praised there.",

    "21 The Master said, The _junzi_ seeks it in himself; the small man seeks it in others.",

    "22 The Master said, The _junzi_ bears himself with dignity but does not contend; he joins with others, but does not become a partisan.",

    "23 The Master said, The _junzi_ does not raise up a man because of his words, and does not discard words because of the man.",
    "15.",
    "24 Zigong asked, “It there a single saying that one may put into practice all one’s life.",
    "” The Master said, “That would be ‘reciprocity’: That which you do not desire, do not do to others.",

    "25 The Master said, In my appraisals of people, whom do I disparage, whom do I praise.",
    "If I praise a man, it is always on the basis of evidence.",
    "These are the people who guided the three eras to walk along the straight _dao_.",

    "Now there are none.",

    "25 The ‘three eras’ of the final phrase refers to the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties.",
    "15.",
    "26 ‘Recorders’ refers to those who kept records at court; the term may be rendered ‘historians’.",
    "An alternative interpretation reads the initial sentence as referring to recorders who lacked cultivation, 15.",
    "27 The Master said, Crafty speech disrupts virtue.",
    "Impatience in small matters disrupts great plans.",
    "15.",
    "28 The Master said, If the masses hate someone, one must investigate the case; if the masses love someone, one must investigate the case.",
    "15.",
    "29 The Master said, A man can enlarge the _dao_ ; it is not that the _dao_ enlarges a man.",
    "15.",
    "30 The Master said, To err and not change – that, we may say, is to err.",
    "15.",
    "31 The Master said, I have spent whole days without eating, whole nights without sleeping, in order to think.",
    "It was useless – not like study.",
    "15.",
    "32 The Master said, The _junzi_ makes plans for the sake of the _dao_ , not for the sake of eating.",
    "Ploughing: there is a starvation in it.",
    "Study: there is a reward in it.",
    "The _junzi_ worries about the _dao_ , not about poverty.",
    "15.",
    "33 The Master said, If one’s knowledge is adequate for it, but one does not possess the _ren_ needed to preserve it, though one gets it, one will surely lose it.",
    "If one’s knowledge is adequate for it and one possesses the _ren_ needed to preserve it, if one is not solemn in dealing directly with them, the people will not show respect.",
    "If one’s knowledge is adequate for it and one possesses the _ren_ needed to preserve it, and one is solemn in dealing directly with the people, if one initiates action that does not accord with _li_ , it will not yet be good.",
    "and takes the loan of horses as a lapse of li , giving the passage a very different sense.",

    "29 This passage makes best sense when ‘enlarge a man’ is taken in the sense of raising his rank or wealth.",
    "15.",
    "31 The contrast between thoughtful reflection and active study is a theme of the 3rd^ century BCE Confucian text Xunzi , which includes a similar passage.",
    "15.",
    "32 There is interesting resonance with 2.",
    "18 here.",
    "Froom its very first passage, the Analects shows a concern with prioritizing learning over pursuit of wealth and status.",
    "It is likely that this was an issue Confucian teachers dealt with regularly in motivating their students (see 8.",
    "12).",
    "15.",
    "33 In this passage, the meaning of the term ren seems reduced to ‘benevolence’, a noncomprehensive virtue that permits of varying degrees.",
    "The overall context clearly refers to those who come into possession of a state or domain.",
    "15.",
    "34 The Master said, The _junzi_ does not accept being known for petty talents, but accepts receiving great burdens.",
    "The small man does not accept receiving great burdens, but accepts being known for petty talents.",
    "15.",
    "35 The Master said, _Ren_ is of greater moment to the people than water or fire.",
    "I have seen people tread through water and fire and die; I have yet to see anyone tread through _ren_ and die.",
    "15.",
    "36 The Master said, When one acts with _ren_ , one does not yield to one’s teacher.",
    "15.",
    "37 The Master said, The _junzi_ is steadfast but not rigid.",
    "15.",
    "38 The Master said, In serving a ruler, be attentive to affairs and consider salary a secondary matter.",
    "15.",
    "39 The Master said, There is a teaching; there are no divisions.",
    "15.",
    "40 The Master said, Do not make plans together with others whose _dao_ differs from yours.",
    "15.",
    "41 The Master said, Words should do no more than convey the idea.",

    "42 Music Master Mian came to visit.",
    "When he reached the steps, the Master said, “Here are the steps.",

    "”  15.",
    "35 The word rendered ‘tread’ ( dao 蹈) was most likely a play on words with dao 道, in the sense of the Way, or to ‘walk the Way’.",
    "Thus ‘tread through ren ’ could be understood as ‘walk the Way of ren ’.",
    "In this and the next passage, we see ren once again used to denote a comprehensive moral virtue.",
    "15.",
    "36 This short passage makes an important statement about the attainment of moral authority and personal autonomy.",
    "15.",
    "37 ‘Steadfast’ implies ethical determination.",
    "‘Rigid’ refers to narrow insistence on according with rules; the same term, in other contexts, denotes faithfulness in promise-keeping.",
    "15.",
    "39 This may mean that the teaching is a whole, without divisions, but it is widely celebrated as saying that there is a single teaching, meant equally for all classes of persons – a radical notion for societies that traditionally regard one’s birth as the basis of one’s worth.",

    "42 In ancient China, musicians were blind men.",
    "After Music Master Mian left, Zizhang asked, “Is that the _dao_ for speaking to a music master.",

    "1 The Ji family was preparing to attack the territory of Zhuanyu.",
    "Ran Yǒu and Ji Lu appeared before Confucius and said, “The Ji family plans to launch an affair against Zhuanyu.",
    "” Confucius said, “Qiu, would this not be your fault.",
    "In the past, the former kings appointed Zhuanyu to be in charge of East Meng Mountain.",
    "Moreover, it lies within the territory of this state, and is hence a subject at the state altars of Lu.",
    "What point is there is attacking it.",
    "” Ran Yǒu said, “It is our master’s wish, not the wish of the two of us.",
    "” Confucius said, “Qiu.",
    "Zhou Ren had a saying: ‘He who can marshal his strength in the effort should take his place in the ranks; he who cannot, should desist.",
    "’ What use to a blind man is an attendant who cannot steady him when the footing is treacherous or pull him up when he falls.",
    "Besides, your words are mistaken.",
    "When the tiger or rhino escape their cages, when the sacred turtle shell or precious stone are smashed while in their boxes, who should be held to blame.",
    "” Ran Yŏu said, “At present, Zhuanyu is, in fact, very near to Bi.",
    "If it is not taken now, it will surely create trouble for the Ji clan descendants.",
    "” Confucius said, “Qiu.",
    "The _junzi_ detests those who cover up their desires by making excuses.",
    "“I have heard it said that those who preside over states or family domains do not worry that they will have too few people, they worry that distribution of goods may be uneven; they do not worry about poverty,  Notes  16.",
    "1 A number of Confucius’s senior disciples were men of importance in Lu, and several of them, most notably Ran Yǒu (Ran Qiu) and Ji Lu (Zhong Yóu; Zilu) were influential stewards at the court of the warlord Ji family (also called Jisun), the de facto power in the state of Lu.",
    "In this passage, they report that the head of the Ji clan (Ji Kangzi) has decided to launch a military attack against a tiny state, Zhuanyu, whose small territory lay entirely within the borders of the state of Lu, in the region of a mountain called East Meng.",
    "Apparently, the lords of Zhuanyu had at some time been entrusted with keeping sacrifices to the spirit of this mountain, and granted a small domain to support them in this task.",
    "Zhuanyu was close to the large Ji family domain and stronghold at Bi, and Ji Kangzi seems to have found its independence an irritant.",
    "This passage illustrates the perils of political engagement with immoral rulers.",
    "Ran Qiu exemplifies the behavior of a man vested in rationalizing immoral conduct by a power holder to whom he is beholden.",
    "The Zhou Ren whom Confucius mentions is said in commentary to have been a historian of earlier times, although there is no confirming evidence that this is so.",
    "In the middle section of Confucius’s final statement here, there may be some corruption of the text – the argument lacks the parallelism one would expect.",
    "In this discussion, Confucius refers to underpopulation.",
    "The scarcest good contended for by rulers durthey worry they will not bring peace.",
    "Is it not so that when distribution is even there is no poverty; when there is harmony there is no underpopulation; when there is peace there is no danger the ruler will topple.",
    "It is just in this spirit that if those who are distant do not submit, one must cultivate patterns and virtue to attract them.",
    "Once they have come, one must comfort them.",
    "“Now you, Qiu and Yóu, attend your master, but those who are distant do not submit and you are unable to attract them, the state is split and crumbing and you are unable to protect it.",
    "Instead, you plot the use of weapons of war within the borders of the state.",
    "I fear that the troubles of the Jisun family lie not with Zhuanyu, but within their own walls.",
    "” 16.",
    "2 Confucius said, When the _dao_ prevails in the world, _li_ , music, and punitive military actions proceed on the order of the Son of Heaven.",
    "When the _dao_ does not prevail in the world, _li_ , music, and punitive military actions proceed on the orders of the feudal lords.",
    "Once they proceed from the feudal lords, it is rare that after ten generations those lords have not lost their power.",
    "Once they proceed from grandees, it is rare that after five generations those grandees have not lost their power.",
    "Once subordinate officers control the fate of the state, it is rare that after three generations they have not lost their power.",
    "When the _dao_ prevails in the world, governance does not lie in the hands of grandees.",
    "When the _dao_ prevails in the world, the common people do not discuss governance.",
    "ing this period was not land – there was plenty of land – it was people who could work the land and produce income for a ruler.",
    "Confucius here suggests two prudential reasons for treating people well: not only will those who are resisting submit, but those who are distant will come to dwell, providing a labor and tax pool.",
    "Virtue and the patterns ( wen ) of a culture ethically ordered by ritual constraint are more effective than coercion and violence in achieving the state goals of the ruler.",
    "16.",
    "2 After 16.",
    "1, the remainder of Book XVI is, for the most part, highly formulaic, and clearly comes from a set of editorial hands different from other books.",
    "For example, passages begin “Confucius said” (Kongzi yue 孔子曰), rather than “The Master said” (Zi yue 子曰), and many passages are numbered lists (something observed also in parts of Book XVII).",
    "The book is not noted for profound insights.",
    "The final sentence of 16.",
    "2 is a reminder that Confucian political ideals were not democratic in any modern sense.",
    "Governance in the interest of the people did not imply government by the people.",
    "The Confucian goal was an ethical authoritarian state, where authority was earned through virtue.",
    "That virtue included a commitment to care for all people.",
    "If successful, the people would not think to dis16.",
    "3 Confucius said, Control of appointments fell from the hands of the ducal house five generations ago.",
    "Governance has been in the hands of the grandees for four generations.",
    "Therefore, the descendants of the ‘three Huan’ families will live in obscurity.",
    "16.",
    "4 Confucius said, There are three types of friends who improve you, and three types of friends who diminish you.",
    "Friends who are straightforward, sincere, and have learned much improve you.",
    "Friends who are fawning, insincere, and crafty in speech diminish you.",
    "16.",
    "5 Confucius said, There are three types of delights that improve you, and three types of delights that diminish you.",
    "To delight in _li_ and music, to delight in speaking of others’ good points, to delight in having many worthy friends – these improve you.",
    "To delight in arrogant pleasures, to delight in idle wanderings, to delight in banquet parties – these diminish you.",
    "16.",
    "6 Confucius said, In attending a ruler there are three mistakes.",
    "To speak of something before an appropriate time has come is to be impetuous; to fail to speak of something when an appropriate time has come is to be secretive; to speak without gauging the ruler’s expression is to be blind.",
    "16.",
    "7 Confucius said, The _junzi_ has three cautions.",
    "When he is young and his blood and energy are not yet settled, he is cautious about sex.",
    "When he is in his prime and his blood and energy have newly achieved strength, he is cautious about combativeness.",
    "cuss issues of policy.",
    "Popular interest in government was a sign of political failure.",
    "Thus political legitimacy derived from the ruler’s good character, expressed through good policy, not from participation of the people, whose character could not be expected to reflect wisdom.",
    "(This Confucian perspective remains a key factor in China to this day.",
    ")  16.",
    "3 Passage 16.",
    "2 set general rules concerning the rate at which power had been devolving in China.",
    "In 16.",
    "3, these rules are applied to the state of Lu, where power had long since passed into the hands of three great grandee families, the Ji, Meng, and Shusun families.",
    "All three traced their lineage origins to the younger sons of Duke Huan of Lu (r.",
    "711-694 BCE ), and therefore were known as the ‘three Huan’ families.",
    "When he is old and his blood and energy are declining, he is cautious about acquisitiveness.",
    "16.",
    "8 Confucius said, The _junzi_ holds three things in awe.",
    "He holds the decree of Tian in awe, he holds great men in awe, and he holds the words of the Sage in awe.",
    "The small man does not know the decree of Tian and so does not hold it in awe, he is disrespectful towards great men, and he disgraces the words of the Sage.",
    "16.",
    "9 Confucius said, Those who are born knowing are the best; next are those who study and come to know it; next are those who study it only in circumstances of duress.",
    "Those who do not study it even under duress, they are the lowest of people.",
    "16.",
    "10 Confucius said, The _junzi_ focuses his attention in nine ways.",
    "In observation, he focuses on clarity; in listening, he focuses on acuity; in facial expression, he focuses on gentleness; in bearing, he focuses on reverence; in words, he focuses on loyalty; in affairs, he focuses on attentiveness; in doubt he focuses on questioning; in anger, he focuses on troublesome consequences; in opportunities to gain, he focuses on right.",
    "16.",
    "11 Confucius said, “‘When he sees the good, he seems rushing to catch up; when he sees the bad, he seems to have touched boiling water’: I have seen such men; I have heard this said of them.",
    "‘He lives in reclusion to seek his heart’s desire; he practices right to spread his _dao_.",

    "However, 17.",
    "5 suggests that some situations reach an extremity of disruption that provides a moral opportunity to wipe the slate clean and construct a moral regime entirely anew.",
    "If that is, indeed, its implication, it extends the doctrine of timeliness in a new direction, implying that the Confucian sage should ‘appear’ even when the dao does not prevail, so long as chaos is pervasive.",
    "Indeed, in the second great Confucian text, the Mencius , timeliness comes to include this idea.",

    "All these revolts failed, and none of these men came to be viewed positively in history.",

    "Ru Bei was apparently a man of influence in Lu (the text refers to ‘Confucius’ only when a power holder is present).",
    "Confucius conveys his disdain for him ‘wordlessly’, through the combination of the messenger and music making.",
    "17.",
    "21 One of the most burdensome of li was the rule that upon the death of a parent, a man must withdraw from society for three years (actually twenty-seven months), eschewing all common pleasures to indulge in concentrated mourning.",
    "Although in this passage Confucius refers to this as a worldwide custom, it was clearly a distinctive feature of Zhou culture.",
    "The reasons given for the custom here are not among the most cogent statements in the Analects.",

    "If a _junzi_ had valor but not righteousness, he would create chaos.",
    "If a small person has valor and not righteousness, he becomes a bandit.",

    "24 Zigong said, “Does the _junzi_ have things he hates.",
    "” The Master said, “He does.",
    "He hates those who proclaim other men’s faults; he hates those who occupy inferior positions but who slander their superiors; he hates those who are valorous but lack _li_ ; he hates those who are bold but lack understanding.",

    "25 In early Confucian literature, this passage stands out as demeaning to women.",
    "‘Small men’ here probably refers to minor male servants.",
    "The passage conflates issues of gender and class, and is the lament of elite males who worry that kindness leads their inferiors to forget their place.",

    "5 The next three passages deal in elaborate ways with the themes of reclusion and timeliness.",
    "The unusual characters whom they describe are the types of figures by later followers of Daoism, a philosophical standpoint that gradually took shape after Confucius’s death.",
    "While Daoism became a rich and multifaceted philosophical approach, its earliest form may have grown from the examples of individual, educated men who chose to abandon the pursuit of social accomplishment amidst the dangerous chaos of centuries of warlord power and multi-state civil war.",
    "Although the rejection of society that early Daoists promoted contrasts with Confucian engagement and social reformism, and there are many other areas where these two trends of thought clash, there are also respects in which they share common values and sentiments.",
    "This can be seen, for instance, in the way in which Yan Hui, Confucius’s favored disciple and a model of perfection (see, e.",
    "g.",
    ", 5.",
    "9), is portrayed as silent, impoverished, and entirely free of political entanglements, in many ways resembling Daoist models of perfection.",
    "Another example, the disciple Yuan Xian (see 14.",

    "Such elements reflect a significant eremitic element in early Confucianism.",
    "Passages 18.",

    "7 Zilu fell behind.",
    "He encountered an old man with a staff, using his staff to carry a basket.",
    "Zilu asked him, “Have you seen my master.",

    "Zigong bowed and stood in place.",
    "The old man had Zilu stop with him overnight.",
    "He killed a chicken and made a millet congee with it, and he fed Zilu, introducing his two sons to him afterwards.",
    "The next day, Zilu caught up and reported all this.",
    "The Master said, “He is a recluse,” and he had Zilu take him back to see the old man.",
    "When they reached the place, the man had gone.",
    "Zilu said, “It is unrighteous not to serve.",
    "The codes that govern the relation of old and young may not be discarded; how can the proper relation of ruler and minister be discarded.",
    "They want to purify their persons, but they disrupt the basic relationships among people.",

    "The Master said, “Never compromising their aims, never subjecting their persons to disgrace – would this not be Bo Yi and Shu Qi.",
    "” He characterized Liuxia Hui and Shao Lian thus: “They compromised their aims  tique: the Confucius of Book XVIII embraces both standpoints, even while making the choice of political engagement.",
    "This is, in effect, the mirror image of the Confucius we see in passages like 17.",

    "If one desires _ren_ and obtains it, wherein is he greedy.",
    "If he never dares to be unmannerly, regardless of whether with many or a few, with the great or the small, is that not to be dignified but not arrogant.",
    "When the _junzi_ sets his cap and robes right, and makes his gaze reverent, such that people stare up at him in awe, is this not, indeed, to be awe-inspiring and not fearsome.",

    "Appendix I: The Major Disciples of Confucius  The major Confucian disciples portrayed in the Analects are listed below by the names the text most frequently uses for them.",
    "In many cases, they are commonly referred to by their “public names.",
    "” This was a name a young man was given in adolescence, and it was used with or without his family surname to refer to him.",
    "Public names frequently began with the word zi , signifying gentleman status – names such as Zilu, Zixia, Zigong are all of this sort.",
    "Each of these men could also be referred to by the personal name they were given at birth: Zilu was named Yóu, and his family surname was Zhong, so he could be called Zhong Yóu.",
    "Confucius, his teacher, just calls him by his personal name, Yóu.",
    "He calls Zixia “Shang” and Zigong “Si” because their family and personal names were Bu Shang and Duanmu Si.",
    "Some disciples are referred to in the Analects by a combination of family surname and public name.",
    "For example, Yan Yuan is referred to in this way, but Confucius calls him Hui, which was the name his family used when speaking to him.",
    "The personal name that Confucius uses is in boldface below.",
    "Although the dates given are approximate and uncertain, the order in which disciples are listed is generally from most senior to most junior.",
    "The names of particularly important disciples are underscored.",
    "Zilu 子路 (Zhong **Yóu** 仲由, c.",
    "542-480) The senior disciple – only nine years younger than Confucius – Zilu is pictured very distinctively as a brash and impulsive warrior, whose natural character Confucius is at pains to temper, often by making fun of him.",
    "Zilu served as steward (estate manager) for the most powerful warlord family of Lu, the Ji clan, and in that role, he comes under frequent criticism.",
    "In his last years, he took a court position in the state of Wei, just north of the Yellow River, not far from Lu.",
    "There, he was slain in a coup d’état one year before Confucius’s own death.",
    "Min Ziqian 閔子騫 (Min Sun 閔損, c.",
    "536.",
    ") Min Ziqian is not a major actor in the _Analects_ ; he appears in only five passages.",
    "However, in four of these, he is singled out for praise or portrayed very positively.",
    "Not much younger than Zilu, he may have been a senior exemplar to junior disciples.",
    "Ran Yǒu 冉有 (Ran **Qiu** 冉求, c.",
    "522-462) Despite his high seniority in the Confucian group, Ran Yǒu is never very clearly delineated as a character in the _Analects_.",
    "He was, in fact, a prominent man in Lu, and served the Ji family in the same manner as Zilu; in this regard, he is comes in for as much or more criticism than Zilu.",
    "The _Analects_ tells us he was practiced in the “arts,” but in which arts is not clear.",
    "Historically, his battlefield accomplishments in Lu during the period of Confucius’s exile allowed him to plead successfully for permission to welcome his master back into the state for his final years.",
    "He does not seem to have played any role in the growth of Confucianism after the Master’s death, and it may be for that reason that he is so colorlessly portrayed in the _Analects_ Zhonggong 仲弓 (Ran **Yong** 冉雍, c.",
    "522-.",
    ") The praise Zhonggong (Yong) receives in 6.",
    "1 is exceptionally high, and although he is a rare presence in the _Analects_ he is nevertheless portrayed with high respect.",
    "The great Confucian Xunzi aligned himself with Zhonggong’s tradition of Confucianism and attacked the tradition of Zeng Shen’s disciple Zisi and his later follower Mencius.",
    "Thus it seems likely that Zhonggong, of whom we know little, shaped a major strain of early Confucianism.",
    "Within the past few years, a bamboo text datable prior to 300 BCE has been recovered, purporting to record a conversation between Confucius and Zhonggong.",
    "Although the text is formulaic and by no means a record of a true conversation, it does confirm that Zhonggong was seen as an important Confucian figure at that early time.",
    "Zhonggong’s father, Boniu, is also praised at several points in the _Analects_.",
    "Yan Yuan 顏淵 (Yan **Hui** 顏回, c.",
    "521-481) Sometimes viewed by later tradition as a sage second only to Confucius, Yan Yuan was a poor man who seems never to have aspired to social position or wealth – he is pictured as being devoted solely to Confucius’s _dao_.",
    "In the Analects, others comment on him often, though he himself rarely has much to say.",
    "Confucius’s mother’s family name was Yan, and it is possible that Yan Yuan was a relation.",
    "The conversation in Book XI, between Confucius and Yan Yuan’s father concerning Yan Yuan’s coffin would make good sense in that context.",
    "Yan Yuan’s early death is the great tragedy of the _Analects_.",
    "Zai Wo 宰我 (Zai **Yu** 宰予, c.",
    "520-481) Zai Wo was a native of the state of Qi whose involvement in political intrigues there ultimately cost him his life.",
    "He is the only disciple who is never portrayed in any but a negative light in the _Analects_ – duplicitous, lazy, argumentative.",
    "It is hard to see from the text why he was accepted as a disciple at all; 5.",
    "10 suggests that Confucius regretted admitting his to the group.",
    "(Bear in mind that this may reflect the attitude of the text’s compilers, since Zai Wo died young.",
    "It may be that it was his fellow disciples who disapproved of him, not his teacher.",
    ") Zigong 子貢 (Duanmu **Si** 端木賜, c.",
    "520-450) One of the most subtle and interesting figures in the _Analects_.",
    "Our sources tell us that Zigong became famous in Lu as a diplomat in state affairs while he was Confucius’s disciple, and then went on to a career of great success as a merchant – an occupation that Confucians tended to denigrate.",
    "In the _Analects_ , Zigong repeatedly appears in passages of great philosophical interest – when you see Zigong in a passage, it’s always worthwhile to read it with special care.",
    "Although he is not known as the founder of a lineage of Confucian instruction, we see him in 19.",
    "22-25 hobnobbing with great lords of Lu and Wei, some of whom regard him as of greater authority than Confucius himself.",
    "When Confucius died, after the other disciples dispersed, Zigong, we are told, built a hut by the grave and mourned there for three years, the office traditionally performed by the eldest son.",
    "(Confucius’s only son had died two years earlier.",
    ") Although the teaching traditions whose later influence is most noted in textual reports seem to have descended from disciples such as Zixia, Zengzi and the very young Zisi (Confucius’s grandson, who does not appear in the _Analects_ ), during the generation after Confucius’s death, Zigong’s personal prominence and measured propagation of the Master’s views may have been a key element in the establishment of the Confucian school.",
    "You Ruo 有若 (called “Youzi”: Master You, c.",
    "518-457) You Ruo is appears several times in Book I of the _Analects_ , referred to as “Master You,” suggesting the authors of those passages were his students, but he appears almost not at all in other books.",
    "Early accounts tell us that after Confucius’s death, the disciples took You Ruo to be their new master, because something in his bearing reminded them of Confucius.",
    "But soon he disappointed their expectations, and they left him.",
    "Fan Chi 樊遲 (Fan **Xu** 樊須, c.",
    "515 -.",
    ") Little is known of Fan Chi, but he is recorded as a soldier in Lu and several times pictured in the _Analects_ driving for Confucius in his chariot.",
    "Yuan Si 原思 (Yuan **Xian** 原憲, c.",
    "515.",
    ") Yuan Si, who appears to be the speakerauthor of 14.",
    "1, referring to himself by his personal name, is best known for having withdrawn from society after Confucius’s death, to live voluntarily the life of an impoverished hermit.",
    "An early source recounts the tale of an encounter between Yuan Xian and the now wealthy merchant Zigong, which leaves Zigong discomfited at Yuan Xian’s superior wisdom and faithfulness to the Confucian _dao_.",
    "Qidiao Kai 漆雕開 (c.",
    "510-450) Although we see Qidiao Kai in only one _Analects_ passage (5.",
    "6), he appears there in very good light, and an early source notes that one of eight early Confucian traditions was that of “Mr.",
    "Qidiao.",
    "” This suggests that Qidiao Kai may have been an influential disciple whose followers took little or no part in compiling the _Analects_.",
    "It may also be, however, that a later group borrowed the unusual surname of an obscure disciple to cloak themselves in the authority of a direct link to the Master.",
    "Gongxi Hua 公西華 (Gongxi **Chi** 公西赤, c.",
    "509 -.",
    ") Although not much is known about Gongxi Hua, he appears to occupy a place among the disciples who were at once men of political notice in the state of Lu, such as Zilu and Ran Yǒu, and men subjected to a critical view by the _Analects_ editors.",
    "This can be seen in his role in the mutually resonant entries 5.",
    "8 and 11.",
    "26, where he is linked with the other two men.",
    "In 11.",
    "26, he is ultimately compared unfavorably with the disciple Zeng Xi, Zeng Shen’s father – likely a literary proxy for the much younger Zeng Shen himself.",
    "Zixia 子夏 (Bu **Shang** 卜商, c.",
    "507-420) Zixia was a younger disciple known for his scholarly bent.",
    "He is associated with the _Poetry_ in the _Analects_ , and was traditionally understood to be the man to whom Confucius conveyed his interpretations of that canonical work.",
    "After Confucius’s death, Zixia received appointment as the court tutor in the great state of Wei (a new state carved from the massive state of Jin in 453).",
    "We can get a sense of the down to earth training he provided his own disciples in Book XIX.",
    "Ziyou 子游 (Yan **Yan** 言偃, c.",
    "506-445) Ziyou does not appear much in the _Analects_ , but he occasionally is quoted directly, as an authority, and is pictured actually getting the best of Confucius in 17.",
    "4, where Confucius makes fun of his governance of a town.",
    "That passage suggests that he laid emphasis on ritual exactitude, but his criticisms of Zixia and other comments in Book XIX tend in the opposite direction.",
    "Zeng **Shen** 曾參 (called “Zengzi,” or Master Zeng, c.",
    "505-436) No disciple likely had more influence on the shape of the emerging Confucian school than Zeng Shen, or Master Zeng (Zengzi).",
    "He became leader of a major Confucian community in Lu, numbering among his disciples Confucius’s grandson Zisi.",
    "This was the tradition that was later led by the great thinker Mencius.",
    "In ther _Analects_ , despite his youth, Zeng Shen speaks with great authority in several passages, such as 4.",
    "15, where he interprets Confucius to the other disciples.",
    "Passages 8.",
    "3 through 8.",
    "7 comprise a small “mini-book” of Zeng Shen’s later sayings, including his deathbed remarks.",
    "Zizhang 子張 (Zhuansun **Shi** 顓孫師, c.",
    "503-450) Zizhang seems to have founded a competing teaching lineage after Confucius’s death.",
    "In the _Analects_ , although Zizhang appears frequently, his personality is not clearly drawn.",
    "However, in Book XIX, which portrays the disciples after Confucius’s death, he is shown in clear conflict with Zixia, Ziyou, and Zeng Shen; in 19.",
    "16-17, the comments attributed to Ziyou and Zeng Shen suggest he was pompous.",
    "Appendix 2: Glossary of Key Terms in the Analects The following terms are considered in this Glossary Dao _de_ (virtue) heart/mind ( _xin_ ) _junzi_ (True prince) _li_ (ritual) _ming_ (fate) _ren_ (humanity) the sage ( _sheng_ ) Tian timeliness ( _shí_ ) _wen_ (pattern) _yi_ (right) ### Dao 道 This term is often translated as “the Way,” but the increasing use of the Chinese term in contemporary English makes it better to leave the term untranslated.",
    "In ancient texts, the word Dao actually possesses a wide range of meanings.",
    "The earliest known forms of the graph for Dao include elements showing a foot, a crossroads, and an eye decorated with an elaborate eyebrow, an element that represents the word _shou_ 首: head.",
    "The head element may have served only to denote the phonetic value of the word _dao_ (the two words were related phonetically in Old Chinese), but the graph may also have been designed to convey semantic information, indicating an early use connected with magical incantations and dances performed by a shaman (a person able to communicate with the world of spirits) as he or she purified a pathway to be used in a religious procession.",
    "If so, then from this pathway connection, the word Dao derives its modern meaning of a path or way; from the formula of the dance, the word derives a meaning of “formula,” “method”; from the spoken element of the incantation, the word derives the meaning of “a teaching,” and also serves as a verb “to speak.",
    "” All ancient schools of philosophy referred to their teachings as _dao_ s.",
    "Confucius and his followers claimed that they were merely transmitting a Dao — the social methods practiced by the sage kings of the past: “the Dao of the former kings.",
    "” Texts in the tradition of early thought that came later to be called “Daoist” used the word in a special sense, which is why the Daoist tradition takes its name from this term.",
    "Daoists claimed that the cosmos itself followed a certain natural “way” in its spontaneous action.",
    "They called this the “Great Dao,” and contrasted it to the _dao_ s of other schools, which were human-created teachings, and which they did not believe merited the name Dao in their special sense.",
    "### De 德 (character, power, virtue) _De_ is a difficult word to translate; its meaning varies considerably with context.",
    "Its early graph shows an upward looking eye next to a half-crossroad, and the significance of this form has been much debated without much result.",
    "In its early uses, _de_ seems to refer to the prestige that well-born and powerful aristocrats possessed as a result of the many gifts they dispensed to loyal followers, family members, and political allies (rather like the prestige associated with a Mafia godfather).",
    "Later, the term came to be associated with important attributes of character.",
    "Although it can be used to refer to both positive or negative features of person, it usually refers to some form of personal “excellence,” and to say that someone has much _de_ is to praise him.",
    "The concrete meaning of this term varies among different schools.",
    "Confucians use it most often to refer to a person’s moral dispositions (moral according to Confucians, at any rate), and in this sense, the word is often best rendered as “character” or “virtue.",
    "” Daoists, however, speak of _de_ as an attribute of both human and non-human participants in the cosmos, and they often describe it as a type of charismatic power or leverage over the limits of nature that the Daoist sage is able to acquire through self-cultivation.",
    "As such, it may be best rendered as “power.",
    "” The title of the famous book, _Dao de jing_ (attributed to an equally famous though probably mythical author named Laozi) means “The Classic of the Dao and De,” and in this title, _de_ is best understood as a type of power derived from transcending (going beyond) the limits of the human ethical world.",
    "##### Heart/Mind ( xin 心) In Chinese, a single word was use to refer both to the function of our minds as a cognitive, reasoning organ and its function as an affective, or emotionally responsive organ.",
    "The word, _xin_ , was originally represented in written form by a sketch of the heart.",
    "Whenever you see the word “mind” or “heart” referred to (the translation will vary according to the context), it’s important to understand that there are really four aspects fused in that term.",
    "The heart/mind thinks rationally, feels emotionally, passes value judgments on all object of thought and feeling, and initiates active responses in line with these judgments.",
    "Sometimes, the heart/mind is contrasted with “unthinking” aspects of people, such as basic desires and instinctual responses, but other times, these are pictured as part of the heart/mind.",
    "## Junzi 君子 (True Prince) This is a compound word composed of two written characters which separately mean “ruler’s son.",
    "” The ancient character for “ruler” ( _jun_ ) showed a hand grasping a writing brush with a mouth placed by the side, illustrating the modes by which a ruler issued orders (the word _zi_ basically meant “child/son,” the written character being simply a picture of a child; it also served as an honorific suffix meaning “master” in names like Kongzi, that is, Confucius, or Master Kong).",
    "In pre-philosophical writings, the word _junzi_ was used to refer to someone who was heir to a ruling position by virtue of his birth.",
    "Under the changing social conditions of the Warring States period, the concept of birthright was replaced by the notion of an “aristocracy of merit,” and in the Confucian school, the term _junzi_ came to denote an “ethical aristocrat” rather than a future king.",
    "Because in this sense of the term, there is an underlying sense that “real” princeliness lies in moral accomplishments rather than the chance circumstances of family position, the term might be translated not as “prince,” but as True Prince.",
    "For Confucians, the hallmark of the _junzi_ was his complete internalization of the virtue of _ren_ and associated qualities, such as righteousness ( _yi_ ) and full socialization through ritual skills.",
    "A parallel normative term, _shi_ 士 (gentleman), is frequent in Confucian texts as a type of prefiguration of the _junzi_ ideal in a man of aspiration.",
    "Originally probably denoting a man of good birth, in the Warring States era the term _shi_ comes to denote a man whose character exemplifies the social accomplishments once associated with birth – a change of meaning paralleling the evolution of the term _junzi_.",
    "In general, the term ### Li 禮 (Ritual) Commitment to ritual was the distinguishing characteristic of the Confucian School.",
    "By “ritual,” or _li_ , the Confucians meant not only ceremonies of grand religious or social occasions, but also the institutions of Zhou Dynasty political culture and the norms of proper everyday conduct.",
    "Although accordance with ritual was, in some senses, a matter of knowing the codes of aristocratic behavior (and knowing them better than the debased aristocrats of the later Zhou era), it was more importantly a manner of attaining full mastery of the style or pattern ( _wen_ ) of civilized behavior.",
    "Confucians viewed these patterns as the essence of civilization itself.",
    "The great sages of the past had labored era after era to transform China from brutishness to refinement through the elaboration of these artistic forms of social interaction, and in the Confucian view, the epitome of human virtue was expressed only through these forms.",
    "Mastery of the outer forms was the path to inner sagehood.",
    "The ancient character for _li_ shows a ceremonial vessel filled with sacrificial goods on the right, with an altar stand on the left.",
    "### Ming 命 (fate, destiny, command, lifespan) The root meaning of _ming_ is a command or order, and early on it became associated with the term Tian in the phrase we translate as “the Mandate of Heaven.",
    "” The original graph shows an open mouth directed down over a kneeling figure (a second mouth element was added later and is reflected in the modern character).",
    "The notion of “what is ordained” was carried over into a meaning of _ming_ that conveys a limited sense of one’s personal fate: “lifespan.",
    "” The notion of “lifespan” conveys an association of _ming_ with human limits (one cannot exceed one’s _ming_ /lifespan, regardless of one’s actions, although one may, through dangerous behavior, meet one’s end prematurely).",
    "The notion of the political mandate, however, carried a strong prescriptive dimension, derived from the original sense of a command — Tian’s mandate is a charge to act, and so expresses not limits but obligations and opportunities.",
    "The double-edged sense of _ming_ as unavoidable “fate” (a negative, limiting sense) and as one’s social “destiny” (which conveys a positive, exhortatory sense) introduces complexity into certain debates in early Chinese thought, centered around a charge made by the Mohist school that Confucianism was “fatalistic.",
    "” ### Ren 仁 (Humanity; Goodness) No term is more important in Confucianism than _ren_.",
    "Prior to the time of Confucius, the term Humanity does not seem to have been much used.",
    "In those pre-philosophical days, the word seems to have meant “manly,” an adjective of high praise in a warrior society.",
    "Confucius, however, changed the meaning of the term and gave it great ethical weight.",
    "He identified “manliness” (or, in non-sexist terms, the qualities associated with constructive social leadership) with the firm disposition to place the needs and feelings of others and of the community before one’s own.",
    "The written graph of this term is a simple one; it combines the form for “person” on the left with the number “two” on the right; a person of Humanity, or _ren_ , is someone who is thoroughly relational in their thoughts, feelings, and actions.",
    "(The happily illustrative graphic etymology is, unfortunately, undercut by recently unearthed manuscript texts of the late fourth century BCE , which consistently render the term with the graph for “body” placed over the graph for “heart/mind”; this may, however, have been a local scribal tradition confined to the southerly region of Chu.",
    ") Confucians often pair this term with Righteousness, and it is very common for the two terms together to be used as a general expression for “morality.",
    "” Other schools also use the term _ren_ , but they usually employ it either to criticize Confucians, or in a much reduced sense, pointing simply to people who are well-meaning.",
    "The term is closely linked in Confucian discourse with the ideal of the _junzi_ ( _Analects_ 4.",
    "5: If one takes _ren_ away from a _junzi_ , wherein is he worthy of the name.",
    ").",
    "### The Sage 聖 ( sheng ) All of the major schools of ancient Chinese thought, with the possible exception of the Legalists, were essentially prescriptions for human self-perfection.",
    "These schools envisioned the outcome of their teachings — the endpoint of their Daos — in terms of different models of human excellence.",
    "A variety of terms were used to describe these images of perfection, but the most common was _sheng_ , or _shengren_ 聖人, which we render in English as “sage person” or, more elegantly, “sage.",
    "” The original graph includes a picture of an ear and a mouth on top (the bottom part merely indicates the pronunciation, and was sometimes left out), and the early concept of the sage involved the notion of a person who could hear better than ordinary people.",
    "The word is closely related to the common word for “to listen” ( _ting_ 聽).",
    "What did the sage hear.",
    "Presumably the Dao.",
    "The word “sage” is one of a group of terms denoting excellence.",
    "In Confucian texts, the phrase True Prince often performs the same function as Sage, though sometimes the sage is pictured as a more complete term, incorporating not only ethical perfection but also success in politics.",
    "Daoist texts speak of the sage often, but also use other terms, such as “Perfect Man” to refer to their ultimate ideal.",
    "### Tian 天 (Heaven) Tian was the name of a deity of the Zhou people which stood at the top of a supernatural hierarchy of spirits (ghosts, nature spirits, powerful ancestral leaders, Tian).",
    "Tian also means “the sky,” and for that reason, it is well translated as “Heaven.",
    "” The early graph is an anthropomorphic image (a picture of a deity in terms of human attributes) that shows a human form with an enlarged head.",
    "Heaven was an important concept for the early Zhou people; Heaven was viewed as an all-powerful and all-good deity, who took a special interest in protecting the welfare of China.",
    "When the Zhou founders overthrew the Shang Dynasty in 1045, they defended their actions by claiming that they were merely receiving the “mandate” of Heaven, who had wished to replace debased Shang rule with a new era of virtue in China.",
    "All early philosophers use this term and seem to accept that there existed some high deity that influenced human events.",
    "The Mohist school was particularly strident on the importance of believing that Tian was powerfully concerned with human activity.",
    "They claimed that the Confucians did not believe Tian existed, although Confucian texts do speak of Tian reverently and with regularity.",
    "In fact, Confucian texts also seem to move towards identifying Tian less with a conscious deity and more with the unmotivated regularities of Nature.",
    "When Daoist texts speak of Heaven, it is often unclear whether they are referring to a deity, to Nature as a whole, or to their image of the Great Dao.",
    "##### Timeliness ( shí 時) Timeliness is the English rendering of _shí_ , which basically means “time” or “season,” and which plays an important philosophical role in Confucianism.",
    "In the _Analects_ , the term rarely appears, though the elements of the doctrine are clearly stated in passages such as 8.",
    "13, which reads, in part, “ When the _dao_ prevails in the world, appear; when it does not, hide.",
    "” The general idea is that for Confucians, the man of full ethical insight (the _junzi_ ) does not act according to rule alone, but always in light of the contextual possibilities presented by changing circumstances.",
    "A more practical instance, which uses the term _shí_ explicitly, occurs in 17.",
    "1, where Confucius’s reluctance to take office under a usurper prompts the remark, “To be eager to engage in affairs but to repeatedly miss one’s _proper time_ ( _shí_ ), can this be called wisdom.",
    "” As the conditions denoted by the term _shí_ always are in potential states of change, the term is intrinsically dynamic.",
    "In the intellectual arena of the era, the term was paired with a near homonym: _shì_ : “configuration,” “strategic position.",
    "” (These terms are transcribed with the same Latin letters, but their sounds are distinguished in Chinese by tonal intonation, indicated here by the diacritic marks.",
    ") The two terms are not related etymologically, but they play parallel conceptual roles in early thought ( _shì_ [strategic position], however, does not appear in the _Analects_ ).",
    "They were, in effect, temporal and spatial correlates of a single concept – the shifting circumstances of the experienced world which form the actual field for all applied learning.",
    "While certain concepts and values essential to right action can be learned through study, the skillful practitioner must develop the aesthetic sense that allows a perception of and responsiveness to the ever-emerging configurations of relationships in time, space, hierarchy, and so forth that create the field of objective constraints on successful application of learning in action.",
    "### Wen 文 (pattern, style, culture) The word _wen_ denoted the opposite of brutishness in appearance and behavior.",
    "A person of “pattern” was a person who had adopted the many cultivated forms that characterized Chinese culture at its best, in contrast to the “barbaric” nomadic peoples who surrounded China.",
    "Confucians believed that the patterns of Chinese civilization had been initially inspired by the patterns of the Heavens and the seasons, and that they represented a Heaven-destined order that human beings needed to fabricate within the sphere of their own activity, so that they could join with Heaven and earth in the process of creation and order.",
    "The original character appears to have pictured a costumed dancer, and music, sound, and dance were essential emblems of the Confucian portrait of the civilized society.",
    "Such patterns were the basis of ritual _li_.",
    "For Daoists, pattern symbolized the fall of the human species from its origins in the natural Dao.",
    "The _Dao de jing_ attacks pattern and culture through its two most striking metaphors for the Dao: the uncarved block of wood and the undyed piece of cloth.",
    "### Yi 義 (right, righteousness, appropriateness) In its earliest uses, _yi_ refers to an aesthetic or artistic appropriateness of appearance (the early graph provides little clue of the word’s early meaning: it shows a sheep above – a graph form common in value-positive words – and “me” below, a graph element which here seems to serve only as a phonetic marker).",
    "Powerful leaders are sometimes said to possess “awesome _yi_ ,” meaning that their outward demeanor included some element of personal charisma or excellence.",
    "Later, the sense of “what is appropriate” came to carry a high ethical content – appropriateness, what fits, was seen as an essential element of correctness or moral rightness.",
    "For Confucians and Mohists in particular, _yi_ was a central concept.",
    "It frequently denotes both propriety and ethical right in action, and those two schools argued pointedly about what the practical content of “righteousness” involved.",
    "For Confucians, _yi_ was closely linked to ritual prescripts; for Mohists, the righteousness of an act was determined by its welfare consequences in the human world without regard for its aesthetic or ritual form.",
    "Appendix 3  An Analysis of Analects , Book VIII (August 2010)  This short analysis was originally written in 1996 as part of a project undertaken by the Warring States Working Group, directed by Bruce Brooks.",
    "It was intended for publication with comments by Bruce and Taeko Brooks included.",
    "When this revision was prepared publication was still pending, but the original version became available in 2012 in Warring States Papers 1 (dated 2010), 93-99.",
    "This 2010 revision was prepared for online course use in order to refine a few points and to make it clearer for those who may read it as an example of the way this type of textual analysis is pursued.",
    "The Brooks’ analysis of the Analects (published as The Original Analects [NY: Columbia, 1999]) is based on an interesting model of the text as a single collection of bamboo strips, growing over time through accretion of discrete new books and ongoing modification by means of insertions in existing books.",
    "Their model permits them to date every book and passage with precision, although the dates rely heavily upon the validity of their premise.",
    "My view is that the text is likely a composite of multiple evolving micro-texts belonging to Confucian disciple groups separated by geography and by teaching traditions, thus I don’t adopt the Brooks’ premise and, more globally, I don’t believe the Analects and its components are datable in the manner the Brooks’ propose, at least not on the evidence we currently have.",
    "Nevertheless, much in their analysis is excellent, including discussions of relative (and even occasionally absolute) dates.",
    "Since this piece was prepared as part of a conversation within their project, I refer to the Brooks’ dates at many points.",
    "I am including this short piece in the online teaching translation (Version 2.",
    "1, 2012) for the first time as an illustration of the way text analysts approach the Analects with regard to dating.",
    "Although the argument and documentation are rather technical, the general approach may make clear why it is important never to regard the Analects as if it were an accurate historical report, composed through a unified editorial process.",
    "As Kimura Eiichi∗^ and others (including Bruce and Taeko Brooks∗∗) have noted, _Analects_ Book VIII has a tripartite structure.",
    "If we label the three sections _A_ , _B_ , _C_ , the ranges are: _A_ : 1, 18-21; _B_ : 2, 8-17; _C_ : 3-7.",
    "A 1 B 2  C 3-7  B 8-17  A 18-21 ∗ (^) Kimura Eiichi 木村英一, _Kōshi to Rongo_ 孔子と論語 (Tokyo: 1971).",
    "∗∗ (^) When this was originally written, the Brooks’s positions were being circulated in unpublished form.",
    "Ultimately, their model of the _Analects_ ’ formation was published as _The Original Analects_ (New York: 1999).",
    "The general nature of these sections can be described as: _A_ : reflections on past sage kings; _B_ : collected sayings of Confucius; _C_ : collected sayings of Zengzi (Master Zeng).",
    "The Brooks have focused on _C_ as the key to dating the book, as it includes the deathbed utterances of Zengzi.",
    "Hence the content of these passages can be dated, using Qian Mu’s chronology of early thinkers, to a terminus a quo of 436 BCE.",
    "The Brooks envision VIII as a memorial text, composed shortly after Zeng Shen’s death.",
    "They thus date the book to c.",
    "435.",
    "_A_ and _B_ (and also 8.",
    "4, which they reasonably view as a late insertion into the Zengzi core) are taken to be intrusions, added later to an essentially integrated book of the _Analects_ text.",
    "I do not wish to quarrel with the Brooks’s dating of 8.",
    "3,5-7.",
    "The problem seems to me to be that the 435 BCE book includes only four entries: a mini-book, to use the Brooks’s term.",
    "I don’t know what a mini-book (about four bamboo strips.",
    "perhaps one per passage.",
    ") would be, and I’m not sure how to picture what the Brooks’s proposal implies.",
    "I think we need a fuller discussion of what _Analects_ VIII is.",
    "**Analysis of the three major components of Book VIII** Let’s deal with _A_ first.",
    "If we reunite the various passages in _A_ and tweak them a bit, they show elements of thematic, lexical, and logical continuity.",
    "Here’s how they stand (I have divided 19 and 20 into two parts; the division in 19 concerns the parallel with the _Mencius_ described below; 20 appears to link distinct passages):  Section A ∗ **1** The Master said, Taibo may be said to have possessed the utmost of virtue.",
    "Thrice he ceded the world to another.",
    "The people could not find words enough to praise him.",
    "**18** The Master said, Towering.",
    "– that Shun and Yu should have possessed the world yet treated none of it as their own.",
    "**19** The Master said, How grand was the rule of the Emperor Yao.",
    "Towering is the grandeur of Tian; only Yao could emulate it.",
    "So boundless the people could find no name great enough for him.",
    "**19b** Towering were his achievements.",
    "Glimmering, they formed an emblem of patterns.",
    "**20a** Shun possessed five ministers and the world was ordered.",
    "King Wu said, “I have ten ministers to curtail the chaos.",
    "” Confucius commented, “Talent is hard to find, is it not.",
    "In the times of Yao and Shun it was most abundant.",
    "Of the ten, one was a woman, it was merely nine.",
    "**20b** “The Zhou controlled two-thirds of the empire, yet continued to serve the Yin.",
    "The virtue of the Zhou may be said to be the utmost of virtue.",
    "” **21** The Master said, I can find no fault in Yu.",
    "Yu was frugal in his own food and drink, but thoroughly filial towards the spirits; he wore shabby clothes, but ritual robes of the finest beauty; his palace chambers were humble, but he exhausted his strength on the waterways that irrigated the fields.",
    "I can find no fault with Yu.",
    "∗ (^) I am using translations of the _Analects_ from my online teaching translation (version 2.",
    "0, 2010), but there are some places where wording differs because of changes in meaning when the text is reanalyzed in this way.",
    "1.",
    "Celebrates Taigong’s insistent renunciation of birthright.",
    "18.",
    "Celebrates Shun and Yu for renouncing [self-]interest in their realms.",
    "19a.",
    "Celebrates Yao for emulating Tian 19b.",
    "Adds comments on his success & culture.",
    "20a.",
    "Numbers the ministers of Shun and King Wu; Confucius comments.",
    "20b.",
    "Celebrates the virtue of the Zhou, who renounced the opportunity to rule.",
    "21.",
    "Celebrates Yu’s combination of simplicity and ritual care.",
    "8.",
    "18-19a appear nearly verbatim in _Mencius_ 3A.",
    "4; however, Yu is not included and the sequence is reversed: **3A.",
    "4**.",
    "Confucius said, ‘How grand was the rule of the Emperor Yao.",
    "How grand is Tian alone, only Yao could emulate it.",
    "So boundless was he the people could find no name for him.",
    "What a ruler Shun was.",
    "Towering.",
    "He possessed all the world, but treated none of it as his own.",
    "’.",
    "There is substantial lexical overlap among the passages of _A_ : the opening phrase of 8.",
    "1, which is followed by a phrase headed with the number three, appears as the close of 8.",
    "20b, preceded by a phrase headed with the number three; the closing phrase of 8.",
    "1 seems to reappear in 8.",
    "19a only slightly altered; both 8.",
    "18 and 8.",
    "19 share an exclamatory phrase.",
    "20a and 21, however, do not seem to share the features of the other passages.",
    "I think that we should look at 8.",
    "1, 18, 19a, and 20b as originally a single text, cut, modified, and rearranged in the _Analects_.",
    "Since we seem to have a post-Mencian emendation in 8.",
    "18, the text date would be later than 300 BCE.",
    "The consistent theme is renunciation, with, perhaps, a prologue remark about Yao’s emulation of Tian as the source of renunciation.",
    "The ur-text would look something like this (preferring the _Mencius_ text to LY):  Ur-text A 大哉，堯之為君！唯天為大，為堯則之。蕩蕩乎！民無能名焉。君哉，舜也！巍巍 乎！有天下而不與焉。[Ｘ哉，泰伯也！Y Y 乎]三以天下讓，民無得而稱焉。Z 哉，文王也！A A 乎！]三分天下有其二，以服事殷。其可謂至德也矣已。 How grand was the rule of the Emperor Yao.",
    "How grand is Tian alone, only Yao could emulate it.",
    "So boundless was he the people could find no name great enough for him.",
    "What a ruler Shun was.",
    "Towering.",
    "He possessed all the world, but treated none of it as his own.",
    "How X was Taibo.",
    "So Y.",
    "Thrice he ceded the world to another.",
    "The people could not find words enough to praise him.",
    "How Z was King Wen.",
    "So A.",
    "Thrice divide the world, he possessed two parts yet continued to serve the Yin.",
    "He may be said to have possessed the utmost of virtue.",
    "There are, of course, other possibilities.",
    "This reconstruction: a) omits Yu in 8.",
    "18, regards 8.",
    "19b as embellished, perhaps by the authors of 5.",
    "13 (where Tian and _wenzhang_ are in opposition), b) makes all passages parallel, c) interprets Zhou as King Wen, and d) takes 20a to be an insertion yet later.",
    "8.",
    "21 is regarded as an attempt to coopt the Mohist paragon Yu (in extremely grudging language that essentially says that although he seems like a Mohist miser-ruler, in fact he followed the Confucian norm of lavishness in ritual life), added together with the insertion in 8.",
    "18.",
    "∗ This reconstruction of _A_ produces a text with only one rough parallel, which appears in _Analects_ 20.",
    "1.",
    "In that passage (regarded by the Brooks as an importation into a book they date to 249 BCE ), we also see Yao linked with Shun, and the connecting theme is the product of Yao’s z _e-_ Tian activity – that is, the action in which he emulated Heaven - creation of the calendar.",
    "Again, there is an intrusion in this late text: at the mention of Yu there is a break in the text and a passage associated with the Shang founder Tang (parallel to _Mozi_ , “Universal Love” III) appears, before the text moves on to the Zhou.",
    "In this manner, we have a parallel slant in the intrusions in VIII _A_ and 20.",
    "1.",
    "(Note that if VIII _A_ and 20.",
    "1 are removed from the _Analects_ , so are all substantive passages concern- ing Yao and Yu, and Shun then appears substantively only in 12.",
    "22 and 15.",
    "5.",
    ")     Turning to _B_ , we see the following array:  Section B (passages with parallels in Book XVII marked ▪ ; 13b/c are indicated as late insertions [see below]) ▪ **2a** The Master said, If one is reverent but without _li_ , one is burdened; if one is vigilant but without _li_ , one is fearful; if one is valorous ( _yong_ 勇) but without _li_ , one causes chaos ( _luan_ 亂); if one is straightforward ( _zhi_ 直) but without _li_ , one causes affronts ( _jiao_ 絞).",
    "**2b** When the _junzi_ is devoted to his parents, the people ( _min_ 民) rise up ( _xing_ 興) as _ren_ ; when he does not discard his old comrades, the people are not dishonest.",
    "▪ **8** The Master said, Rise up ( _xing_ 興) with the _Poetry_ , stand with _li_ , consummate with music.",
    "**9** The Master said, The people ( _min_ 民) can be made to follow it, they cannot be made to understand it.",
    "▪ **10** The Master said, When one who loves only valor is placed under the stress of poverty, the result is chaos.",
    "If a person is not _ren_ , placing them under stress leads to extremes, and chaos follows.",
    "**11** The Master said, If a person had ability as splendid as the Duke of Zhou, but was otherwise arrogant and stingy, the rest would not be worth a glance.",
    "**12** The Master said, A student willing to study for three years without obtaining a salaried position is hard to come by.",
    "**13a** The Master said, Be devoted to faithfulness and love learning; defend the good _dao_ until death; do not enter a state poised in danger and do not remain in a state plunged in chaos.",
    "**13b** When the _dao_ prevails in the world, appear; when it does not, hide.",
    "**13c** When the _dao_ prevails in a state, to be poor and of low rank is shameful; when the _dao_ does not prevail in a state, to be wealthy and of high rank is shameful.",

    "16 and 17.",
    "14 both bemoan faults unmitigated by positive qualities, and name     strings of faults that begin with _kuang_ 狂.",
    "Let’s hypothesize that these passages (2a, 8, 10, 16) were initially independent of the other sections of _B_ (note that 2a and 16 form a balanced bracket for the four).",
    "If we remove them, we will see that 2b and 9 are linked by a concern with the people: _min_ 民; 11 and 12 concern failures of talented people (arrogance; ambition); 13a and 14 concern pursuing the _dao_ while keeping clear of unnecessary entanglements (let 13b/c be a later intrusion, but with no agenda separate from 13a); 15 and 17 celebrate music and Confucian study.",
    "This is a cogent paired structure, a pattern identified as regular by the Brooks.",
    "Perhaps we can label these two portions of _B_ , _B1_ and _B2_.",
    "B1 2b, 9, 11, 12, 13a, 14, 15, 17 B2 2a, 8, 10,16 The merger of _B1_ and _B2_ works well in some regards.",
    "8.",
    "8 picks up the _xing_ of 8.",
    "2b, and is presumably placed where it is for that reason.",
    "8.",

    "11.",
    "17).",
    "8.",
    "2a and 8.",
    "16 would serve as good brackets on the theme of balance, and it may be that 16 & 17 were reversed in order at a later point.",
    "As far as dating goes, we might date _B2_ in terms of contemporaneity with XVII.",
    "I have no real proposal for _B1_.",
    "There may be some resonance with _Analects_ I; 2b may say what the murky last phrases of 1.",
    "13 mean, 9 includes vocabulary and an issue related to 1.",
    "12 (both these are You Ruo passages), and the association of wealth and arrogance is an issue in 1.",
    "15 (a Zigong passage).",
    "As a provisional theory, perhaps we can speculate that _B2_ is produced by the group that produced Book XVII, _B1_ by the group that produced Book I.",
    "In the Brooks’s scheme, this would place the dates for both rather close (though the Brooks do not include 1.",
    "12 among Book I ur-passages), c.",
    "301/272 BCE ; let us say, then, that by the Brooks dating scheme, _B1_ was created c.",
    "301, and _B2_ interpolated c.",
    "272.",
    "_A_ , then, would have come to bracket them post-249.",
    "Why would _A_ bracket _B_.",
    "We might suspect two reasons.",
    "First, if _B_ were bound strips, there would be plenty of room for more: _B_ totals only 11 passages, all short, apart from the composite 8.",
    "2 & 13.",
    "Even if _C_ had been incorporated earlier (which I’ll suggest below), the book would still be shorter than most.",
    "Second, there is thematic resonance between the renunciationist interest of _A_ , which focuses on _rang_ 讓 (yielding position) and the theme of timeliness and renunciation of ambition in _B_ (8.",
    "11-14).",
    "The theme of timeliness is the theme of 8.",
    "3 also (Zeng Shen’s display of his bodily integrity, proof that he escaped the danger of the times); it leads off _C_ , and is presumably its point of compatibility with _B_.",
    "The final passage of _B_ does not deal with timeliness, but creates a link with 13a on the theme of the Dao followed till death.",
    "∗  Section C **3** Master Zeng fell ill.",
    "He summoned the disciples of his school.",
    "“Uncover my feet; uncover my hands.",
    "The _Poetry_ says, _All vigilance, all caution /As though nearing the edge of abyss, /As though treading upon thin ice.",
    "_ “My young friends, from this point on, I know that I have escaped whole.",
    "” ∗ (^) We may also note that 8.",
    "14 recurs at 14.",
    "26 with an amplifying comment from Zengzi (though taking it in a direction somewhat different from the one I’m giving 8.",
    "14 here).",
    "**4** Master Zeng fell ill.",
    "Meng Jingzi called upon him.",
    "Master Zeng said, “When a bird is about to die, his call is mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are good.",
    "“There are three things a _junzi_ cherishes in the _dao_.",
    "In attitude and bearing, keep far from arrogance; in facial expression, keep closely aligned to faithfulness; in uttering words, keep far from coarse abrasiveness.",
    "So far as minor matters of ritual implements are concerned, there are functionaries to take care of that.",
    "” **5** Master Zeng said, To be able, yet to ask advice of those who are not able, to have much, yet to ask advice of those who have little, to view possession as no different than lacking, fullness as no different than emptiness, to be transgressed against yet not to bear a grudge – in past times, I had a friend who worked to master these things.",
    "**6** Master Zeng said, A man to whom one can entrust a growing youth of middling stature and a territory a hundred _lĭ_ square, who, nearing a great crisis, cannot be waylaid from his purpose – would such a man not be a _junzi_.",
    "Such a man would be a _junzi_.",
    "**7** Master Zeng said, A gentleman cannot but be broad in his determination.",
    "His burden is heavy and his road ( _dao_ ) is long.",
    "He takes _ren_ to be his burden – is the burden not heavy.",
    "Only with death may he lay it down – is the road not long.",
    "Thus, the most likely formula representing the growth of _Analects_ , Book VIII would run like this.",
    "_C_ (Brooks, 435 BCE ) wrapped by _B_ (Brooks c.",
    "272) wrapped by _A_ (after 249), with _B1_ (c.",
    "301) having been previously wrapped in _B2_.",
    "So how do we date _Analects_ VIII.",
    "Is it conceivable that in the accretion ordering scheme proposed by the Brooks, the tiny _C_ remained sandwiched between IV-VII (479450) and IX-X (405-380), and then later amidst II-XV (added 356-308), and perhaps I and XVI (301-284), until at last the generation of XVII joined with texts of the generation of I and wrapped _C_ c.",
    "272, _C_ having remained a tiny, isolated bundle in the midst of the growing _Analects_ bulk for over 150 years.",
    "I don’t think that will work – the wrapping would have been too obvious.",
    "Had VIII been confined to _C_ all that time, it would have been the most conspicuous of all the books for a century: the Zengzi book.",
    "The human logic of any generation of disciples collectively hiding that text within an unremarkable collection of Confucius quotes is too elusive – whatever the motive, would there not surely have been someone with a copy or a memory of the text who would have said, Hey.",
    "What did you do with Zengzi.",
    "An explanation would be required even without the Zengzi problem – how could a book in the VIII position be completely repackaged by the _A_ -level wrapping at the close of the Zhou.",
    "My own view of the development of Book VIII differs from the Brooks’s, and lacks any precision in dating, which is, in any event, only relative in my analysis.",
    "I regard, in a rather traditional fashion, Books III-VII, excluding late intrusions, as one core _Analects_ text (the original “upper text” [ _shanglun_ 上論], a term that ultimately came to denote Books I-X), with passages sorted into books by topic.",
    "I see Book VIII, perhaps originally only section _B1_ , as an 8-passage appended miscellany.",
    "Since I view Books IX and X as pre-edited importations developed by a separate editorial stream, perhaps quite early, but incorporated into the current text relatively late, Book VIII could have remained as a final book, un-“sandwiched,” for some time.",
    "On this model, _B2_ would be seen as probably added next, with the Zengzi section _C_ finding a home within this 12-passage book, but slipped in after the initial 2a-b compound so that the book was not “headlined” as a Zengzi-book, but rather, like other _Analects_ books, a book of the Master’s sayings with some sayings of disciples included.",
    "The move to wrap the book in _A_ , originally an entirely different type of Confucian text, would probably have been made quite late, perhaps even after Book IX was added (since the 16 passages of _B_ + _C_ would no longer have made Book VIII seem like a mere appendix), but perhaps not after the “lower text,” Books XI and up, were merged with the “upper text,” or at least not after Books XVIII and XX was incorporated in the “lower text,” since those would seem more eligible locations for _A_ than Book VIII.",
    "**Additional notes on Analects VIII** 8.",
    "2: The word _luan_ appears in 8.",
    "2a; as noted, it resonates with passages in Book XVII.",
    "In fact, the word _luan_ appears in only thirteen _Analetcs_ passages: four are in _B_ (and twice in 8.",
    "10), one in _A_ , and four more in _Analects_ I (1) and XVII (3), the two books I’ve suggested are linked to _Analects_ VIII.",
    "The senses of _luan_ in _Analects_ VIII vary, and the significance of these concordance-obsessed statistics is tenuous, but it’s unusual that 60% of all _Analects_ passages including _luan_ appear in Books VIII and XVII.",
    "8.",
    "3: The _Liji_ “Tan Gong” chapter gives background to an alternative explication.",
    "The tale there concerns Zengzi’s deathbed command to lift him off a bed mat that he viewed as dishonorable – it was a gift from the Jisun family.",
    "In that (and all other) versions of the story, _shou_ 手 (hands) is replaced by _shou_ 首 (head), and the command is not to “expose” his limbs (by lifting covers), but to lift his dying body (grasping from the head and feet).",
    "Zengzi’s mat-removal was a close call, so the “Tan Gong” tale goes: his son opposed it on the grounds that so sick a man should not be moved, but Zengzi was insistent.",
    "He dies shortly after lying back down.",
    "Now the complete “Tan Gong” is probably a Han Dynasty product, but I think the anecdote fits the text extremely well as a contextualizing teaching-tradition.",
    "The need to import Zengzi’s filial reputation into an exegesis disappears.",
    "What he has evaded is not bodily harm and dishonor to his parents, but the dishonor of obligation to an illegitimate warlord – a dishonor which would have reflected upon him and upon his school, and which was almost accrued through inattention, mitigated only through alertness comparable to that of one walking by the edge of cliff or on thin ice.",
    "This explanation requires an additional text emendation.",
    "The problematic word _qi_ 啟, never well explained (“expose,” the usual gloss, has, I believe, no parallel) must be replaced by _qi_ 起: “lift up.",
    "” By Axel Schuessler’s reconstruction of Old Chinese,∗^ this emends *khîʔ with *khəʔ; not as close as we might want, but consideration of the strange phrase in 3.",
    "8 (He who _bears me up_ is Shang) suggests that the reverse loan occurs there ∗ (^) _Minimal Old Chinese and Later Han Chinese_ (Honolulu: 2009).",
    "(He who _enlightens_ me is Shang).",
    "A further oddity links 3.",
    "8 and 8.",
    "3, and suggests that the use of 起/啟 in those passages may be related: the pronoun _yu_ 予 (‘me’) appears as the object of the verb in both.",
    "There are only fourteen passages with this pronoun form in the _Analects_ ; two are in cited _Shangshu_ -like contexts (8.",
    "20a; 20.",
    "1), another in cited speech (13.",
    "15), another by a self-styled ruler (17.",
    "1), indicating the use of _yu_ as mock-humble, six others in Tian-related contexts, which indicate humble form.",
    "This leaves four passages, including 3.",
    "8 and 8.",
    "3, with similar attached verbs.",
    "All of this involves allowing “Tan Gong” a certain priority over the _Analects_.",
    "It assumes that “Tan Gong” has an independent source more transparent than the _Analects_ – clearly, the “Tan Gong” anecdote could not be derived directly from the _Analects_ as we have it, with “hand” for “head.",
    "” This somewhat undermines the notion of the canonicity of the _Analects_ Zengzi fragments for the Zengzi teaching tradition (which surely lies behind “Tan Gong”), and suggests overall a rather more fluid picture of the core Confucian texts during the period 479-c.",
    "150 BCE than we might prefer.",
    "Appendix 4  How Did the Analects Come to Be.",
    "– Manuscript Evidence Since the Qing Dynasty scholar Cui Shu (1740-1816) first applied systematic text critical analysis to consider the possibility that the _Analects_ was not a unitary work, scholars have increasingly recognized that the text is the process of a long period of composition by many hands.",
    "(See the brief discussion in the Introduction, pp.",
    "iii-vi, and Appendix 3.",
    ") Very recently a new window on the origins of the text has opened: since the 1990s, manuscripts written in ink on bamboo strips, recovered from tombs in southern areas such as Hubei (once part of the ancient state of Chu) and datable to the late fourth century BCE, have revealed a range of previously unknown texts (and some early versions of familiar ones) that were circulating during the Warring States era.",
    "Some of these may bear on our understanding of the _Analects_ , particularly a few that resemble the _Analects_ in form and that recount short conversations or narratives concerning Confucius and his disciples.",
    "Two of these texts, published by the Shanghai Museum in 2005, include a number of passages that resemble to various degrees passages in the _Analects_ as we know it, and this suggests that they may have played a role in or reflect the long editorial process that yielded the current text.",
    "They may reproduce texts that were early direct sources of the _Analects_ , or they may be variants of early versions of the book, teachings that were altered by Confucian masters before the _Analects_ became a fixed text, essentially unalterable because of its growing doctrinal authority.",
    "The two texts were published under the names “The _Junzi_ Practices Ritual” ( _Junzi wei li_ ) and “The Disciples Asked” ( _Dizi wen_ ).",
    "Although the content of the two texts shared much in common, the original editor of the texts, Zhang Guangyu 張光裕, believed that the calligraphic style of the two was distinct enough that they were written by different hands or at different times.",
    "Such judgments are always provisional in the case of recovered bamboo texts, since they are encountered in tombs only as loose strips embedded in soil, and a major editorial task is sequencing the strips and sorting different texts.",
    "Two outstanding scholars, Chen Jian 陳劍 and Huang Ren’er 黃人二, have argued that the strips in this case all belong to a single text and have devised cogent reconstructions on that basis.",
    "My own view is that close examination of character forms and calligraphic style confirms Zhang’s original analysis: the slip groups originally sorted as distinct texts do (with one exception of a mis-sorted strip) show clear evidence of two different calligraphic hands, not merely the use of variant forms by a single hand.",
    "Characteristic traits of each hand (visible in graphs such as _ye_ 也 and _bu_ 不, and elements such as _hu_ 虍 and _you_ 又), appear in consistent patterns on individual slips.",
    "Consequently, any argument for a unified text must assume composition by two scribes, and the specific theories proposed would further require that these scribes alternated slips within contiguous passages in a random pattern.",
    "While this is not impossible, to adopt such a model would require much more compelling evidence of improved textual coherence than these theories offer.",
    "This appendix offers translations and comments on these two texts, which are the best current examples of a new type of evidence that will surely change our view of the _Analects_ in the years to come.",
    "It does not include fully scholarly analysis, and although I have interspersed (in blue typeface) comments on the text and notes (occasionally detailed) on some technical issues, I have not addressed many arguments concerning the order in which the bamboo slips should be presented and readings of individual characters.",
    "Apart from the original editor’s ideas, discussion of these texts has appeared in print and online publications, and I list at the end of this introduction items I have consulted in preparing this translation (which is significantly modified from the preliminary 2007 version included as Appendix 3 in the 2010 version of this teaching translation [2.",
    "0]).",
    "For both texts, I have included a transcription of the Chinese text as well as translation.",
    "This reconstruction numbers the sequence of individual passages in each text: the numbering is speculative because we don’t know the original order of the bamboo slips; moreover some slips are clearly missing, many sections are fragmentary and difficult to reconstruct.",
    "In some cases, a passage number stands by a single orphan character, signifying that we can infer that a passage including the character existed, but it is otherwise lost (there may be other lost passages for which no remnant characters survive).",
    "In both the Chinese transcription and the translation, individual bamboo strips ends are indicated by arrow-brackets ( ．．．), with ellipsis dots indicating where one end or another may be broken, signifying likely lost text.",
    "Original text marks are indicated by the form ■; all other punctuation is added.",
    "The original strip numbers assigned in the Shanghai Museum edition are included (my numbered rearrangements will be evident).",
    "*  This photograph reproduces what the translation below takes to be the initial bamboo strip of the text “The Junzi Practices Ritual.",
    "” The three segments are actually a single strip divided for the purpose of high-resolution publication.",
    "The top of the strip is the segment on the right.",
    "As is evident, the bottom of the strip at the lower left is actually broken mid-character; only about forty percent of the original strip survives.",

    "This would account for the possessive reference to “our Zichan” (the late prime minister of Zheng) that appears in the text, but which I alter in passage 6 to simple “Zichan” by treating wu 吾 as an intrusion.",
    "Huang’s solution is reasonable, but I have not followed it because, apart from the reading of xing being less consistent with the graph form of the manuscript, the intrusion of zi seems to me less likely than a scribal intrusion of wu , since wuzi 吾子 (our Master) might easily have occurred to a scribe transcribing text concerning two disciples referring to Confucius, especially since the graph appearing before wu was a near homophone.",

    "Yanling Jizi (Lord Ji of Yanling) is a title for the Wu prince Ji Zha 季札, active during the second half of the sixth century.",
    "Texts tell us that although he was only the fourth son of Shoumeng, king of Wu, Ji Zha was offered the throne as a young man, his three older brothers ceding to him in accord with the wish of his late father, who recognized the exceptional virtue of his youngest son.",
    "Ji Zha, however, like his ancestor Tai Bo ( Analects 8.",
    "1), resolutely declined, and withdrew to his estate in Yanling.",
    "Despite the supposed Zhou origins of the Wu royal house, Wu was considered remote and barbarian, which may be the topic of the truncated end of Slip 2.",
    "Tales of Ji Zha’s virtue and of his political prescience as an envoy touring the courts of northern China made him a natural object of admiration for Ru.",
    "Notes: All commentators have followed Zhang in equating qian 前 with yan 延 in the name Yanling Jizi, and in reading yu 浴 (bathe) as su 俗 (custom).",
    "My reading of zai 在 (in) differs from the usual reading of qi 七 (seven).",
    "The cluster of four unidentified characters near the beginning of Slip 1 has drawn a variety of suggestions from scholars, including an intriguing proposal by Chen Jian that the last of these, which he reasonably argues should be read ying 膺 (chest; to receive), concerns the ancient Wu custom of tattooing, which Ji Zha is praised for rejecting.",
    "Chen’s suggestion notwithstanding, it seems more likely that Ji Zha is being celebrated for repeatedly declining the throne.",
    "The “custom” in question may concern passing the throne from elder to younger brother, which applied in Ji Zha’s generation: his final abdication came only after the death of his third elder brother, when his succession would have been regular.",
    "I suspect that the first two graphs in this series (pictured at left) represent this brother’s name, which is rendered in traditional orthography as Yumei 餘眛.",
    "The first graph appears to include the element 飠(as in 餘); the latter may include the phonetic element mo 𠬛𠬛 (Old Chinese *mət), close to the later phonetic element wei 未 (*məs) in mei 眛, while the unknown element at the upper left may have reduced to 目 in later orthographic renderings of Yumei’s name.",
